The author glorifies and thanks God for the Torah, prays for protection from sinners enraged by others' fidelity to the law, laments the cost of obedience, delights in the law's consolations, begs for wisdom to understand the precepts, and asks for the rewards of keeping them. Several expected elements do not appear in the psalm: Mount Sinai with its story of God's revelation and gift to Israel of instruction and commandments, the temple and other institutions related to revelation and laws (frequent in other psalms). The psalm is fascinated with God's word directing and guiding human life. The poem is an acrostic; its twenty-two stanzas (of eight verses each) are in the order of the Hebrew alphabet. Each of the eight verses within a stanza begins with the same letter. Each verse contains one word for \"instruction.\" The translation here given attempts to translate each Hebrew word for \"instruction\" with the same English word. There are, however, nine words for \"instruction,\" not eight, so the principle of a different word for \"instruction\" in each verse cannot be maintained with perfect consistency. The nine words for \"instruction\" in the translation are: law, edict, command, precept, word, utterance, way, decree, and teaching.","2":"[19] A sojourner in the land: like someone without the legal protection of a native inhabitant, the psalmist has a special need for the guidance of God's teaching","3":"[32] For you open my docile heart: literally, \"you make broad my heart.&quot","4":"[48] I lift up my hands to your commands: to lift up the hands was an ancient gesture of reverence to God.

The psalmist describes near loss of faith ( Psalm 73:2-3), occasioned by observing the wicked who blasphemed God with seeming impunity ( Psalm 73:4-12). Feeling abandoned despite personal righteousness, the psalmist could not bear the injustice until an experience of God's nearness in the temple made clear how deluded the wicked were. Their sudden destruction shows their impermanence ( Psalm 73:13-20). The just can thus be confident, for, as the psalmist now knows, their security is from God ( Psalm 73:1, 23-28).","2":"[9] They set their mouths against the heavens: in an image probably derived from mythic stories of half-divine giants, the monstrous speech of the wicked is likened to enormous jaws gaping wide, devouring everything in sight","3":"[10] The Hebrew is obscure","4":"And came to understand their end: the psalmist receives a double revelation in the temple: 1) the end of the wicked comes unexpectedly ( Psalm 73:18-20); 2) God is with me","5":"[24] And at the end receive me with honor: a perhaps deliberately enigmatic verse.

The first part ( Psalm 51:3-10) asks deliverance from sin, which is not just a past act but its emotional, physical, and social consequences. The second part ( Psalm 51:11-19) seeks something more profound than wiping the slate clean: nearness to God, living by the spirit of God ( Psalm 51:12-13), like the relation between God and people described in Jeremiah 31:33-34. Nearness to God brings joy and the authority to teach sinners ( Psalm 51:15-16). Such proclamation is better than offering sacrifice ( Psalm 51:17-19).

The translation assumes the psalm accompanied the early autumn Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkoth), which included a procession of the tribes ( Psalm 68:25-28). Israel was being oppressed by a foreign power, perhaps Egypt ( Psalm 68:31-32) - unless Egypt stands for any oppressor. The psalm may have been composed from segments of ancient poems, which would explain why the transitions are implied rather than explicitly stated. At any rate, Psalm 68:2 is based on Numbers 10:35-36, and Psalm 68:8-9 are derived from Judges 5:4-5. The argument develops in nine stanzas (each of three to five poetic lines): 1. confidence that God will destroy Israel's enemies ( Psalm 68:2-4); 2. call to praise God as savior ( Psalm 68:5-7); 3. God's initial rescue of Israel from Egypt ( Psalm 68:8), the Sinai encounter ( Psalm 68:9), and the settlement in Canaan ( Psalm 68:10-11); 4. the defeat of the Canaanite kings ( Psalm 68:12-15); 5. the taking of Jerusalem, where Israel's God will rule the world ( Psalm 68:16-19); 6. praise for God's past help and for the future interventions that will be modeled on the ancient exodus-conquest ( Psalm 68:20-24); 7. procession at the Feast of Tabernacles ( Psalm 68:25-28); 8. prayer that the defeated enemies bring tribute to the temple (29-32); 9. invitation for all kingdoms to praise Israel's God (33-35).","2":"[2] The opening line alluding to Numbers 10:35 makes clear that God's assistance in the period of the exodus and conquest is the model and assurance of all future divine help","3":"[5] Exalt the rider of the clouds: God's intervention is in the imagery of Canaanite myth in which the storm-god mounted the storm clouds to ride to battle. Such theophanies occur throughout the psalm: Psalm 68:2-3, 8-10, 12-15, 18-19, 22-24, 29-32, 34-35. See Deut 33:26; Psalm 18:8-16; Isaiah 19:1","4":"[7] While rebels live in the desert: rebels must live in the arid desert, whereas God's people will live in the well-watered land ( Psalm 68:8-11)","5":"[12-15] The Hebrew text upon which the translation is based has apparently suffered dislocation and has been substantially rearranged for sense. The version of the defeat of the kings differs from that in the book of Joshua, where the people play a significant role. Here God alone is responsible for the victory (though the actual battle is not described); Israel only gathers the spoils. God alone is the source of Israel's success; human effort is not important","6":"[15] Zalmon: generally taken as the name of a mountain where snow is visible in winter, perhaps to be located in the Golan Heights or in the mountains of Bashan or Hauran east of the Sea of Galilee","7":"[17] The mountain: Mount Zion, the site of the temple","8":"[23] Even from Bashan . . . from the depths of the sea: the heights and the depths, the farthest places where enemies might flee","9":"[25-28] Your procession: the procession renews God's original taking up of residence on Zion, described in Psalm 68:16-19","10":"[31] The wild beast of the reeds: probably the Nile crocodile, a symbol for Egypt; see Psalm 68:32 and Ezekiel 29:2-5","11":"[31] Psalm 68:32[29-30] Lower Egypt is the delta area north of Cairo.

The psalmist is content to be known as one of \"the needy,\" \"the poor,\" \"the just,\" \"the upright\" ( Psalm 140:13), a class of people expecting divine protection.","2":"[4] Similar metaphors for a wicked tongue are used in Psalm 52:2; 55:20; 58:3","3":"[6] Have set a trap . . . have spread a net: the same figure, of hunters setting traps, occurs in Psalm 9:16; 31:5; 35:7; 64:6.
