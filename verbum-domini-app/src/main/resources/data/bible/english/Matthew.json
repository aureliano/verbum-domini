He prepares for his entry into the city in such a way as to make it a fulfillment of the prophecy of Zechariah 9:9 ( Matthew 21:2) that emphasizes the humility of the king who comes ( Matthew 21:5). That prophecy, absent from the Marcan parallel account ( Matthew 11:1-11) although found also in the Johannine account of the entry ( Matthew 12:15), is the center of the Matthean story. During the procession from Bethphage to Jerusalem, Jesus is acclaimed as the Davidic messianic king by the crowds who accompany him ( Matthew 21:9). On his arrival the whole city was shaken, and to the inquiry of the amazed populace about Jesus' identity the crowds with him reply that he is the prophet, from Nazareth in Galilee ( Matthew 21:10, 11)","2":"[1] Bethphage: a village that can no longer be certainly identified. Mark mentions it before Bethany ( Mark 11:1), which suggests that it lay to the east of the latter. The Mount of Olives: the hill east of Jerusalem that is spoken of in Zechariah 14:4 as the place where the Lord will come to rescue Jerusalem from the enemy nations.","3":"[2] An ass tethered, and a colt with her: instead of the one animal of Mark 11:2 Matthew has two, as demanded by his understanding of Zechariah 9:9","4":"[4-5] The prophet: this fulfillment citation is actually composed of two distinct Old Testament texts, Isaiah 62:11 (Say to daughter Zion) and Zechariah 9:9. The ass and the colt are the same animal in the prophecy, mentioned twice in different ways, the common Hebrew literary device of poetic parallelism. That Matthew takes them as two is one of the reasons why some scholars think that he was a Gentile rather than a Jewish Christian who would presumably not make that mistake (see Introduction)","5":"[7] Upon them: upon the two animals; an awkward picture resulting from Matthew's misunderstanding of the prophecy","6":"[8] Spread . . . on the road: cf 2 Kings 9:13. There is a similarity between the cutting and strewing of the branches and the festivities of Tabernacles ( Lev 23:39-40); see also 2 Macc 10:5-8 where the celebration of the rededication of the temple is compared to that of Tabernacles","7":"[9] Hosanna: the Hebrew means \"(O Lord) grant salvation\"; see Psalm 118:25, but that invocation had become an acclamation of jubilation and welcome. Blessed is he . . . in the name of the Lord: see Psalm 118:26 and the note on John 12:13. In the highest: probably only an intensification of the acclamation, although Hosanna in the highest could be taken as a prayer, \"May God save (him).&quot","8":"[10] Was shaken: in the gospels this verb is peculiar to Matthew where it is used also of the earthquake at the time of the crucifixion ( Matthew 27:51) and of the terror of the guards of Jesus' tomb at the appearance of the angel ( Matthew 28:4). For Matthew's use of the cognate noun, see the note on Matthew 8:24","9":"[11] The prophet: see Matthew 16:14 (\"one of the prophets\") and 21:46","10":"[12-17] Matthew changes the order of ( Mark 11:11, 12, 15) and places the cleansing of the temple on the same day as the entry into Jerusalem, immediately after it. The activities going on in the temple area were not secular but connected with the temple worship. Thus Jesus' attack on those so engaged and his charge that they were making God's house of prayer a den of thieves ( Matthew 21:12-13) constituted a claim to authority over the religious practices of Israel and were a challenge to the priestly authorities. Matthew 21:14-17 are peculiar to Matthew. Jesus' healings and his countenancing the children's cries of praise rouse the indignation of the chief priests and the scribes ( Matthew 21:15). These two groups appear in the infancy narrative ( Matthew 2:4) and have been mentioned in the first and third passion predictions ( Matthew 16:21; 20:18). Now, as the passion approaches, they come on the scene again, exhibiting their hostility to Jesus","11":"[12] These activities were carried on in the court of the Gentiles, the outermost court of the temple area. Animals for sacrifice were sold; the doves were for those who could not afford a more expensive offering; see Lev 5:7. Tables of the money changers: only the coinage of Tyre could be used for the purchases; other money had to be exchanged for that","12":"[13] \"My house . . . prayer': cf Isaiah 56:7. Matthew omits the final words of the quotation, \"for all peoples\" (\"all nations\"), possibly because for him the worship of the God of Israel by all nations belongs to the time after the resurrection; see Matthew 28:19. A den of thieves: the phrase is taken from Jeremiah 7:11","13":"[14] The blind and the lame: according to 2 Sam 5:8 (LXX) the blind and the lame were forbidden to enter \"the house of the Lord,\" the temple. These are the last of Jesus' healings i","14":"[15] The wondrous things: the healings","15":"[16] \"Out of the mouths . . . praise': cf Psalm 8:3 (LXX)","16":"[18-22] In Mark the effect of Jesus' cursing the fig tree is not immediate; see Mark 11:14, 20. By making it so, Matthew has heightened the miracle. Jesus' act seems arbitrary and ill-tempered, but it is a prophetic action similar to those of Old Testament prophets that vividly symbolize some part of their preaching; see, e.g., Ezekiel 12:1-20. It is a sign of the judgment that is to come upon the Israel that with all its apparent piety lacks the fruit of good deeds ( Matthew 3:10) and will soon bear the punishment of its fruitlessness ( Matthew 21:43). Some scholars propose that this story is the development in tradition of a parable of Jesus about the destiny of a fruitless tree, such as Luke 13:6-9. Jesus' answer to the question of the amazed disciples ( Matthew 21:20) makes the miracle an example of the power of prayer made with unwavering faith ( Matthew 21:21-22)","17":"[21] See Matthew 17:20","18":"[23-27] Cf Mark 11:27-33. This is the first of five controversies between Jesus and the religious authorities of Judaism in Matthew 21:23- 22:46 Presented in the form of questions and answers","19":"[23] These things: probably his entry into the city, his cleansing of the temple, and his healings there","20":"[24] To reply by counterquestion was common in rabbinical debate","21":"[26] We fear . . . as a prophet: cf Matthew 14:5","22":"[27] Since through embarrassment on the one hand and fear on the other the religious authorities claim ignorance of the origin of John's baptism, they show themselves incapable of speaking with authority; hence Jesus refuses to discuss with them the grounds of his authority","23":"[28-32] The series of controversies is interrupted by three parables on the judgment of Israel ( Matthew 21:28- 22:14) of which this, peculiar to Matthew, is the first. The second ( Matthew 21:33-46) comes from Mark ( 12:1-12), and the third ( Matthew 22:1-14) from Q; see Luke 14:15-24. This interruption of the controversies is similar to that in Mark, although Mark has only one parable between the first and second controversy. As regards Mattew's first parable, Matthew 21:28-30 if taken by themselves could point simply to the difference between saying and doing, a theme of much importance in this gospel (cf Matthew 7:21; 12:50); that may have been the parable's original reference. However, it is given a more specific application by the addition of Matthew 21:31-32. The two sons represent, respectively, the religious leaders and the religious outcasts who followed John's call to repentance. By the answer they give to Jesus' question ( Matthew 21:31) the leaders condemn themselves. There is much confusion in the textual tradition of the parable. Of the three different forms of the text given by important textual witnesses, one has the leaders answer that the son who agreed to go but did not was the one who did the father's will. Although some scholars accept that as the original reading, their arguments in favor of it seem unconvincing. The choice probably lies only between a reading that puts the son who agrees and then disobeys before the son who at first refuses and then obeys, and the reading followed in the present translation. The witnesses to the latter reading are slightly better than those that support the other","24":"[31] Entering . . . before you: this probably means \"they enter; you do not.&quot","25":"[32] Cf Luke 7:29-30. Although the thought is similar to that of the Lucan text, the formulation is so different that it is improbable that the saying comes from Q. Came to you . . . way of righteousness: several meanings are possible: that John himself was righteous, that he taught righteousness to others, or that he had an important place in God's plan of salvation. For the last, see the note on Matthew 3:14-15","26":"[33-46] Cf Mark 12:1-12. In this parable there is a close correspondence between most of the details of the story and the situation that it illustrates, the dealings of God with his people. Because of that heavy allegorizing, some scholars think that it does not in any way go back to Jesus, but represents the theology of the later church. That judgment applies to the Marcan parallel as well, although the allegorizing has gone farther in Matthew. There are others who believe that while many of the allegorical elements are due to church sources, they have been added to a basic parable spoken by Jesus. This view is now supported by the Gospel of Thomas, #65, where a less allegorized and probably more primitive form of the parable is found","27":"[33] Planted a vineyard . . . a tower: cf Isaiah 5:1-2. The vineyard is defined in Isaiah 5:7 as \"the house of Israel.&quot","28":"[34-35] His servants: Matthew has two sendings of servants as against Mark's three sendings of a single servant ( Mark 11:2-5a) followed by a statement about the sending of \"many others\" ( Mark 11:2, 5b). That these servants stand for the prophets sent by God to Israel is clearly implied but not made explicit here, but see Matthew 23:37. His produce: cf Mark 12:2 \"some of the produce.\" The produce is the good works demanded by God, and his claim to them is total","29":"[38] Acquire his inheritance: if a Jewish proselyte died without heir, the tenants of his land would have final claim on it","30":"[39] Threw him out . . . and killed him: the change in the Marcan order where the son is killed and his corpse then thrown out ( Matthew 12:8) was probably made because of the tradition that Jesus died outside the city of Jerusalem; see John 19:17; Hebrews 13:12","31":"[41] They answered: in Mark 12:9 the question is answered by Jesus himself; here the leaders answer and so condemn themselves; cf Matthew 21:31. Matthew adds that the new tenants to whom the vineyard will be transferred will give the owner the produce at the proper times","32":"[42] Cf Psalm 118:22-23. The psalm was used in the early church as a prophecy of Jesus' resurrection; see Acts 4:11; 1 Peter 2:7. If, as some think, the original parable ended at Matthew 21:39 it was thought necessary to complete it by a reference to Jesus' vindication by God","33":"[43] Peculiar to Matthew. Kingdom of God: see the note on Matthew 19:23-24. Its presence here instead of Matthew's usual \"kingdom of heaven\" may indicate that the saying came from Matthew's own traditional material. A people that will produce its fruit: believing Israelites and Gentiles, the church of Jesus","34":"[44] The majority of textual witnesses omit this verse. It is probably an early addition to Matthew from Luke 20:18 with which it is practically identical","35":"[45] The Pharisees: Matthew inserts into the group of Jewish leaders ( Matthew 21:23) those who represented the Judaism of his own time"}},"2":{"verses":{"1":{"verse":"When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of King Herod, behold, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem,","annotations":["1","2"]},"2":{"verse":"saying, \"Where is the newborn king of the Jews?

Israel, God's son, was called out of Egypt at the time of the Exodus; Jesus, the Son of God, will similarly be called out of that land in a new exodus.

The vague expression \"through the prophets\" may be due to Matthew's seeing a connection between Nazareth and certain texts in which there are words with a remote similarity to the name of that town.

The two stories depend on Mark 2:23-28; 3:1-6 respectively, and are the only places in either gospel that deal explicitly with Jesus' attitude toward sabbath observance","2":"[1-2] The picking of the heads of grain is here equated with reaping, which was forbidden on the sabbath ( Exodus 34:21).","3":"[3-4] See 1 Sam 21:2-7. In the Marcan parallel ( Mark 2:25-26) the high priest is called Abiathar, although in 1 Sam this action is attributed to Ahimelech. The Old Testament story is not about a violation of the sabbath rest; its pertinence to this dispute is that a violation of the law was permissible because of David's men being without food","4":"[5-6] This and the following argument ( Matthew 12:7) are peculiar to Matthew. The temple service seems to be the changing of the showbread on the sabbath ( Lev 24:8) and the doubling on the sabbath of the usual daily holocausts ( Numbers 28:9-10). The argument is that the law itself requires work that breaks the sabbath rest, because of the higher duty of temple service. If temple duties outweigh the sabbath law, how much more does the presence of Jesus, with his proclamation of the kingdom (something greater than the temple), justify the conduct of his disciples","5":"[7] See the note on Matthew 9:13","6":"[8] The ultimate justification for the disciples' violation of the sabbath rest is that Jesus, the Son of Man, has supreme authority over the law","8":"[11] Matthew omits the question posed by Jesus in Mark 3:4 and substitutes one about rescuing a sheep on the sabbath, similar to that in Luke 14:5","9":"[14] See Mark 3:6. Here the plan to bring about Jesus' death is attributed to the Pharisees only. This is probably due to the situation of Matthew's church, when the sole opponents were the Pharisees","10":"[15-21] Matthew follows Mark 3:7-12 but summarizes his source in two verses ( Matthew 12:15, 16) that pick up the withdrawal, the healings, and the command for silence. To this he adds a fulfillment citation from the first Servant Song ( Isaiah 42:1-4) that does not correspond exactly to either the Hebrew or the LXX of that passage. It is the longest Old Testament citation in this gospel, emphasizing the meekness of Jesus, the Servant of the Lord, and foretelling the extension of his mission to the Gentiles","11":"[15] Jesus' knowledge of the Pharisees' plot and his healing all are peculiar to Matthew","12":"[19] The servant's not contending is seen as fulfilled in Jesus' withdrawal from the disputes narrated in Matthew 12:1-14","13":"[21] Except for a minor detail, Matthew here follows the LXX, although the meaning of the Hebrew (\"the coastlands will wait for his teaching\") is similar","14":"[22-32] For the exorcism, see the note on Matthew 9:32-34. The long discussion combines Marcan and Q material ( Mark 3:22-30; Luke 11:19-20, 23; 12:10). Mark 3:20-21 is omitted, with a consequent lessening of the sharpness of Matthew 12:48","15":"[23] See the note on Matthew 9:27","16":"[24] See the note on Matthew 10:25","17":"[25-26] Jesus' first response to the Pharisees' charge is that if it were true, Satan would be destroying his own kingdom","18":"[27] Besides pointing out the absurdity of the charge, Jesus asks how the work of Jewish exorcists (your own people) is to be interpreted. Are they, too, to be charged with collusion with Beelzebul? For an example of Jewish exorcism see Josephus, Antiquities 8,2,5, 42-49","19":"[28] The Q parallel ( Luke 11:20) speaks of the \"finger\" rather than of the \"spirit\" of God. While the difference is probably due to Matthew's editing, he retains the kingdom of God rather than changing it to his usual \"kingdom of heaven.\" Has come upon you: see Matthew 4:17","20":"[29] A short parable illustrates what Jesus is doing. The strong man is Satan, whom Jesus has tied up and whose house he is plundering. Jewish expectation was that Satan would be chained up in the last days ( Rev 20:2); Jesus' exorcisms indicate that those days have begun","21":"[30] This saying, already attached to the preceding verses in Q (see Luke 11:23), warns that there can be no neutrality where Jesus is concerned. Its pertinence in a context where Jesus is addressing not the neutral but the bitterly opposed is not clear. The accusation of scattering, however, does fit the situation. Jesus is the shepherd of God's people ( Matthew 2:6), his mission is to the lost sheep of Israel ( Matthew 15:24); the Pharisees, who oppose him, are guilty of scattering the sheep","22":"[31] Blasphemy against the Spirit: the sin of attributing to Satan ( Matthew 12:24) what is the work of the Spirit of God ( Matthew 12:28)","23":"[33] Declare: literally, \"make.\" The meaning of this verse is obscure. Possibly it is a challenge to the Pharisees either to declare Jesus and his exorcisms good or both of them bad. A tree is known by its fruit; if the fruit is good, so must the tree be. If the driving out of demons is good, so must its source be","24":"[34] The admission of Jesus' goodness cannot be made by the Pharisees, for they are evil, and the words that proceed from their evil hearts cannot be good","25":"[36-37] If on the day of judgment people will be held accountable for even their careless words, the vicious accusations of the Pharisees will surely lead to their condemnation","26":"[38-42] This section is mainly from Q (see Luke 11:29-32). Mark 8:11-12, which Matthew has followed in Matthew 16:1-4, has a similar demand for a sign. The scribes and Pharisees refuse to accept the exorcisms of Jesus as authentication of his claims and demand a sign that will end all possibility of doubt. Jesus' response is that no such sign will be given. Because his opponents are evil and see him as an agent of Satan, nothing will convince them","27":"[38] Teacher: see the note on Matthew 8:19. In Matthew 16:1 the request is for a sign \"from heaven\" ( Mark 8:11)","28":"[39] Unfaithful: literally, \"adulterous.\" The covenant between God and Israel was portrayed as a marriage bond, and unfaithfulness to the covenant as adultery; cf Hosea 2:4-14; Jeremiah 3:6-10","29":"[40] See Jonah 2:1. While in Q the sign was simply Jonah's preaching to the Ninevites ( Luke 11:30, 32), Matthew here adds Jonah's sojourn in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights, a prefigurement of Jesus' sojourn in the abode of the dead and, implicitly, of his resurrection","30":"[41-42] The Ninevites who repented (see Jonah 3:1-10) and the queen of the south (i.e., of Sheba; see 1 Kings 10:1-13) were pagans who responded to lesser opportunities than have been offered to Israel in the ministry of Jesus, something greater than Jonah or Solomon. At the final judgment they will condemn the faithless generation that has rejected him","31":"[43-45] Another Q passage; cf Matthew 11:24-26. Jesus' ministry has broken Satan's hold over Israel, but the refusal of this evil generation to accept him will lead to a worse situation than what preceded his coming","32":"[46-50] See Mark 3:31-35. Matthew has omitted Mark 3:20-21 which is taken up in Mark 3:31 (see the note on Matthew 12:22-32), yet the point of the story is the same in both gospels: natural kinship with Jesus counts for nothing; only one who does the will of his heavenly Father belongs to his true family","33":"[47] This verse is omitted in some important textual witnesses, including Codex Sinaiticus (original reading) and Codex Vaticanus"}},"22":{"verses":{"1":{"verse":"Jesus again in reply spoke to them in parables, saying,","annotations":["1"]},"2":{"verse":"\"The kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son.","annotations":["2"]},"3":{"verse":"He dispatched his servants to summon the invited guests to the feast, but they refused to come.","annotations":["3"]},"4":{"verse":"A second time he sent other servants, saying, 'Tell those invited: \"Behold, I have prepared my banquet, my calves and fattened cattle are killed, and everything is ready; come to the feast.\"'","annotations":[]},"5":{"verse":"Some ignored the invitation and went away, one to his farm, another to his business.","annotations":[]},"6":{"verse":"The rest laid hold of his servants, mistreated them, and killed them.","annotations":[]},"7":{"verse":"The king was enraged and sent his troops, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.","annotations":["4"]},"8":{"verse":"Then he said to his servants, 'The feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy to come.","annotations":[]},"9":{"verse":"Go out, therefore, into the main roads and invite to the feast whomever you find.'","annotations":[]},"10":{"verse":"The servants went out into the streets and gathered all they found, bad and good alike, and the hall was filled with guests.","annotations":["5"]},"11":{"verse":"But when the king came in to meet the guests he saw a man there not dressed in a wedding garment.","annotations":["6"]},"12":{"verse":"He said to him, 'My friend, how is it that you came in here without a wedding garment?'

It has been given many allegorical traits by Matthew, e.g., the burning of the city of the guests who refused the invitation ( Matthew 22:7), which corresponds to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in A.D. 70. It has similarities with the preceding parable of the tenants: the sending of two groups of servants ( Matthew 22:3, 4), the murder of the servants ( Matthew 22:6) the punishment of the murderers ( Matthew 22:7), and the entrance of a new group into a privileged situation of which the others had proved themselves unworthy ( Matthew 22:8-10). The parable ends with a section that is peculiar to Matthew ( Matthew 22:11-14), which some take as a distinct parable. Matthew presents the kingdom in its double aspect, already present and something that can be entered here and now ( Matthew 22:1-10), and something that will be possessed only by those present members who can stand the scrutiny of the final judgment ( Matthew 22:11-14). The parable is not only a statement of God's judgment on Israel but a warning to Matthew's church.","2":"[2] Wedding feast: the Old Testament's portrayal of final salvation under the image of a banquet ( Isaiah 25:6) is taken up also in Matthew 8:11; cf Luke 13:15","3":"[3-4] Servants . . . other servants: probably Christian missionaries in both instances; cf Matthew 23:34","4":"[7] See the note on Matthew 22:1-14","5":"[10] Bad and good alike: cf Matthew 13:47","6":"[11] A wedding garment: the repentance, change of heart and mind, that is the condition for entrance into the kingdom ( Matthew 3:2; 4:17) must be continued in a life of good deeds ( Matthew 7:21-23)","7":"[13] Wailing and grinding of teeth: the Christian who lacks the wedding garment of good deeds will suffer the same fate as those Jews who have rejected Jesus; see the note on Matthew 8:11-12","8":"[15-22] The series of controversies between Jesus and the representatives of Judaism (see the note on Matthew 21:23-27) is resumed. As in the first ( Matthew 21:23-27), here and in the following disputes Matthew follows his Marcan source with few modifications","9":"[15] The Pharisees: while Matthew retains the Marcan union of Pharisees and Herodians in this account, he clearly emphasizes the Pharisees' part. They alone are mentioned here, and the Herodians are joined with them only in a prepositional phrase of Matthew 22:16. Entrap him in speech: the question that they will pose is intended to force Jesus to take either a position contrary to that held by the majority of the people or one that will bring him into conflict with the Roman authorities","10":"[16] Herodians: see the note on Mark 3:6. They would favor payment of the tax; the Pharisees did not","11":"[17] Is it lawful: the law to which they refer is the law of God","12":"[19] They handed him the Roman coin: their readiness in producing the money implies their use of it and their acceptance of the financial advantages of the Roman administration in Palestine","13":"[21] Caesar's: the emperor Tiberius (A.D. 14-37). Repay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar: those who willingly use the coin that is Caesar's should repay him in kind. The answer avoids taking sides in the question of the lawfulness of the tax. To God what belongs to God: Jesus raises the debate to a new level. Those who have hypocritically asked about tax in respect to its relation to the law of God should be concerned rather with repaying God with the good deeds that are his due; cf Matthew 21:41, 43","14":"[23-33] Here Jesus' opponents are the Sadducees, members of the powerful priestly party of his time; see the note on Matthew 3:7. Denying the resurrection of the dead, a teaching of relatively late origin in Judaism (cf Daniel 12:2), they appeal to a law of the Pentateuch ( Deut 25:5-10) and present a case based on it that would make resurrection from the dead ridiculous ( Matthew 22:24-28). Jesus chides them for knowing neither the scriptures nor the power of God ( Matthew 22:29). His argument in respect to God's power contradicts the notion, held even by many proponents as well as by opponents of the teaching, that the life of those raised from the dead would be essentially a continuation of the type of life they had had before death ( Matthew 22:30). His argument based on the scriptures ( Matthew 22:31-32) is of a sort that was accepted as valid among Jews of the time","15":"[23] Saying that there is no resurrection: in the Marcan parallel ( Matthew 22:12, 18) the Sadducees are correctly defined as those \"who say there is no resurrection\"; see also Luke 20:27. Matthew's rewording of Mark can mean that these particular Sadducees deny the resurrection, which would imply that he was not aware that the denial was characteristic of the party. For some scholars this is an indication of his being a Gentile Christian; see the note on Matthew 21:4-5","16":"[24] \"If a man dies . . . his brother': this is known as the \"law of the levirate,\" from the Latin levir, \"brother-in-law.\" Its purpose was to continue the family line of the deceased brother ( Deut 25:6)","17":"[29] The sexual relationships of this world will be transcended; the risen body will be the work of the creative power of God","18":"[31-32] Cf Exodus 3:6. In the Pentateuch, which the Sadducees accepted as normative for Jewish belief and practice, God speaks even now (to you) of himself as the God of the patriarchs who died centuries ago. He identifies himself in relation to them, and because of their relation to him, the living God, they too are alive. This might appear no argument for the resurrection, but simply for life after death as conceived in Wisdom 3, 1-3. But the general thought of early first-century Judaism was not influenced by that conception; for it human immortality was connected with the existence of the body","19":"[34-40] The Marcan parallel ( Mark 12:28-34) is an exchange between Jesus and a scribe who is impressed by the way in which Jesus has conducted himself in the previous controversy ( Mark 12:28), who compliments him for the answer he gives him ( Mark 12:32), and who is said by Jesus to be \"not far from the kingdom of God\" ( Mark 12:34). Matthew has sharpened that scene. The questioner, as the representative of other Pharisees, tests Jesus by his question ( Matthew 22:34-35), and both his reaction to Jesus' reply and Jesus' commendation of him are lacking","20":"[35] [A scholar of the law]: meaning \"scribe.\" Although this reading is supported by the vast majority of textual witnesses, it is the only time that the Greek word so translated occurs in Matthew. It is relatively frequent in Luke, and there is reason to think that it may have been added here by a copyist since it occurs in the Lucan parallel ( Luke 10:25-28). Tested: see the note on Matthew 19:3","21":"[36] For the devout Jew all the commandments were to be kept with equal care, but there is evidence of preoccupation in Jewish sources with the question put to Jesus","22":"[37-38] Cf Deut 6:5. Matthew omits the first part of Mark's fuller quotation ( Mark 12:29; Deut 6:4-5), probably because he considered its monotheistic emphasis needless for his church. The love of God must engage the total person (heart, soul, mind)","23":"[39] Jesus goes beyond the extent of the question put to him and joins to the greatest and the first commandment a second, that of love of neighbor, Lev 19:18; see the note on Matthew 19:18-19. This combination of the two commandments may already have been made in Judaism","24":"[40] The double commandment is the source from which the whole law and the prophets are derived","25":"[41-46] Having answered the questions of his opponents in the preceding three controversies, Jesus now puts a question to them about the sonship of the Messiah. Their easy response ( Matthew 22:43a) is countered by his quoting a verse of Psalm 110 that raises a problem for their response (43b-45). They are unable to solve it and from that day on their questioning of him is ended","26":"[41] The Pharisees . . . questioned them: Mark is not specific about who are questioned ( Mark 12:35)","27":"[42-44] David's: this view of the Pharisees was based on such Old Testament texts as Isaiah 11:1-9; Jeremiah 23:5; and Ezekiel 34:23; see also the extrabiblical Psalms of Solomon Psalm 17:21. How, then . . . saying: Jesus cites Psalm 110:1 accepting the Davidic authorship of the psalm, a common view of his time. The psalm was probably composed for the enthronement of a Davidic king of Judah. Matthew assumes that the Pharisees interpret it as referring to the Messiah, although there is no clear evidence that it was so interpreted in the Judaism of Jesus' time. It was widely used in the early church as referring to the exaltation of the risen Jesus. My lord: understood as the Messiah","28":"[45] Since Matthew presents Jesus both as Messiah ( Matthew 16:16) and as Son of David ( Matthew 1:1; see also the note on Matthew 9:27), the question is not meant to imply Jesus' denial of Davidic sonship. It probably means that although he is the Son of David, he is someone greater, Son of Man and Son of God, and recognized as greater by David who calls him my \"lord."}},"6":{"verses":{"1":{"verse":"\"(But) take care not to perform righteous deeds in order that people may see them; otherwise, you will have no recompense from your heavenly Father.","annotations":["1"]},"2":{"verse":"When you give alms, do not blow a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets to win the praise of others.

In each, the conduct of the hypocrites ( Matthew 6:2) is contrasted with that demanded of the disciples. The sayings about reward found here and elsewhere ( Matthew 5:12, 46; 10:41-42) show that this is a genuine element of Christian moral exhortation. Possibly to underline the difference between the Christian idea of reward and that of the hypocrites, the evangelist uses two different Greek verbs to express the rewarding of the disciples and that of the hypocrites; in the latter case it is the verb apecho, a commercial term for giving a receipt for what has been paid in full ( Matthew 6:2, 5, 16).","2":"[2] The hypocrites: the scribes and Pharisees, see Matthew 23:13, 15, 23, 25, 27, 29. The designation reflects an attitude resulting not only from the controversies at the time of Jesus' ministry but from the opposition between Pharisaic Judaism and the church of Matthew. They have received their reward: they desire praise and have received what they were looking for","3":"[7-15] Matthew inserts into his basic traditional material an expansion of the material on prayer that includes the model prayer, the \"Our Father.\" That prayer is found in Luke 11:2-4 in a different context and in a different form","4":"[7] The example of what Christian prayer should be like contrasts it now not with the prayer of the hypocrites but with that of the pagans. Their babbling probably means their reciting a long list of divine names, hoping that one of them will force a response from the deity","5":"[9-13] Matthew's form of the \"Our Father\" follows the liturgical tradition of his church. Luke's less developed form also represents the liturgical tradition known to him, but it is probably closer than Matthew's to the original words of Jesus","6":"[9] Our Father in heaven: this invocation is found in many rabbinic prayers of the post-New Testament period. Hallowed be your name: though the \"hallowing\" of the divine name could be understood as reverence done to God by human praise and by obedience to his will, this is more probably a petition that God hallow his own name, i.e., that he manifest his glory by an act of power (cf Ezekiel 36:23), in this case, by the establishment of his kingdom in its fullness","7":"[10] Your kingdom come: this petition sets the tone of the prayer, and inclines the balance toward divine rather than human action in the petitions that immediately precede and follow it. Your will be done, on earth as in heaven: a petition that the divine purpose to establish the kingdom, a purpose present now in heaven, be executed on earth","8":"[11] Give us today our daily bread: the rare Greek word epiousios, here daily, occurs in the New Testament only here and in Luke 11:3. A single occurrence of the word outside of these texts and of literature dependent on them has been claimed, but the claim is highly doubtful. The word may mean daily or \"future\" (other meanings have also been proposed). The latter would conform better to the eschatological tone of the whole prayer. So understood, the petition would be for a speedy coming of the kingdom (today), which is often portrayed in both the Old Testament and the New under the image of a feast ( Isaiah 25:6; Matthew 8:11; 22:1-10; Luke 13:29; 14:15-24)","9":"[12] Forgive us our debts: the word debts is used metaphorically of sins, \"debts\" owed to God (see Luke 11:4). The request is probably for forgiveness at the final judgment","10":"[13] Jewish apocalyptic writings speak of a period of severe trial before the end of the age, sometimes called the \"messianic woes.\" This petition asks that the disciples be spared that final test","11":"[14-15] These verses reflect a set pattern called \"Principles of Holy Law.\" Human action now will be met by a corresponding action of God at the final judgment","12":"[16] The only fast prescribed in the Mosaic law was that of the Day of Atonement ( Lev 16:31), but the practice of regular fasting was common in later Judaism; cf Didache Matthew 9:1","13":"[19-34] The remaining material of this chapter is taken almost entirely from Q. It deals principally with worldly possessions, and the controlling thought is summed up in Matthew 6:24, the disciple can serve only one master and must choose between God and wealth (mammon). See further the note on Luke 16:9","14":"[22-23] In this context the parable probably points to the need for the disciple to be enlightened by Jesus' teaching on the transitory nature of earthly riches","15":"[24] Mammon: an Aramaic word meaning wealth or property","16":"[25-34] Jesus does not deny the reality of human needs ( Matthew 6:32), but forbids making them the object of anxious care and, in effect, becoming their slave","17":"[27] Life-span: the Greek word can also mean \"stature.\" If it is taken in that sense, the word here translated moment (literally, \"cubit\") must be translated literally as a unit not of time but of spatial measure. The cubit is about eighteen inches","18":"[30] Of little faith: except for the parallel in Luke 12:28, the word translated of little faith is found in the New Testament only in Matthew. It is used by him of those who are disciples of Jesus but whose faith in him is not as deep as it should be (see Matthew 8:26; 14:31; 16:8 and the cognate noun in Matthew 17:20)","19":"[33] Righteousness: see the note on Matthew 3:14-15"}},"13":{"verses":{"1":{"verse":"On that day, Jesus went out of the house and sat down by the sea.","annotations":["1"]},"2":{"verse":"Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat down, and the whole crowd stood along the shore.","annotations":[]},"3":{"verse":"And he spoke to them at length in parables, saying: \"A sower went out to sow.","annotations":["2","3"]},"4":{"verse":"And as he sowed, some seed fell on the path, and birds came and ate it up.","annotations":[]},"5":{"verse":"Some fell on rocky ground, where it had little soil.

Matthew follows the Marcan outline ( Mark 4:1-35) but has only two of Mark's parables, the five others being from Q and M. In addition to the seven parables, the discourse gives the reason why Jesus uses this type of speech (Matthew 10-15), declares the blessedness of those who understand his teaching (Matthew 16-17), explains the parable of the sower (Matthew 18-23) and of the weeds (Matthew 36-43), and ends with a concluding statement to the disciples (Matthew 51-52).","2":"[3-8] Since in Palestine sowing often preceded ploughing, much of the seed is scattered on ground that is unsuitable. Yet while much is wasted, the seed that falls on good ground bears fruit in extraordinarily large measure. The point of the parable is that, in spite of some failure because of opposition and indifference, the message of Jesus about the coming of the kingdom will have enormous success","3":"[3] In parables: the word \"parable\" (Greek parabole) is used in the LXX to translate the Hebrew mashal, a designation covering a wide variety of literary forms such as axioms, proverbs, similitudes, and allegories. In the New Testament the same breadth of meaning of the word is found, but there it primarily designates stories that are illustrative comparisons between Christian truths and events of everyday life. Sometimes the event has a strange element that is quite different from usual experience (e.g., in Matthew 13:33 the enormous amount of dough in the parable of the yeast); this is meant to sharpen the curiosity of the hearer. If each detail of such a story is given a figurative meaning, the story is an allegory. Those who maintain a sharp distinction between parable and allegory insist that a parable has only one point of comparison, and that while parables were characteristic of Jesus' teaching, to see allegorical details in them is to introduce meanings that go beyond their original intention and even falsify it. However, to exclude any allegorical elements from a parable is an excessively rigid mode of interpretation, now abandoned by many scholars","4":"[11] Since a parable is figurative speech that demands reflection for understanding, only those who are prepared to explore its meaning can come to know it. To understand is a gift of God, granted to the disciples but not to the crowds. In Semitic fashion, both the disciples' understanding and the crowd's obtuseness are attributed to God. The question of human responsibility for the obtuseness is not dealt with, although it is asserted in Matthew 13:13. The mysteries: as in Luke 8:10; Mark 4:11 has \"the mystery.\" The word is used in Daniel 2:18, 19, 27 and in the Qumran literature (1QpHab 7:8; 1QS 3:23; 1QM 3:9) to designate a divine plan or decree affecting the course of history that can be known only when revealed. Knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven means recognition that the kingdom has become present in the ministry of Jesus","5":"[12] In the New Testament use of this axiom of practical \"wisdom\" (see Matthew 25:29; Mark 4:25; Luke 8:18; 19:26), the reference transcends the original level. God gives further understanding to one who accepts the revealed mystery; from the one who does not, he will take it away (note the \"theological passive,\" more will be given, what he has will be taken away)","6":"[13] Because \"they look . . . or understand': Matthew softens his Marcan source, which states that Jesus speaks in parables so that the crowds may not understand ( Mark 4:12), and makes such speaking a punishment given because they have not accepted his previous clear teaching. However, his citation of Isaiah 6:9-10 in Matthew 13:14 supports the harsher Marcan view","7":"[16-17] Unlike the unbelieving crowds, the disciples have seen that which the prophets and the righteous of the Old Testament longed to see without having their longing fulfilled","8":"[18-23] See Mark 4:14-20; Luke 8:11-15. In this explanation of the parable the emphasis is on the various types of soil on which the seed falls, i.e., on the dispositions with which the preaching of Jesus is received. The second and third types particularly are explained in such a way as to support the view held by many scholars that the explanation derives not from Jesus but from early Christian reflection upon apostasy from the faith that was the consequence of persecution and worldliness respectively. Others, however, hold that the explanation may come basically from Jesus even though it was developed in the light of later Christian experience. The four types of persons envisaged are (1) those who never accept the word of the kingdom ( Matthew 13:19); (2) those who believe for a while but fall away because of persecution ( Matthew 13:20-21); (3) those who believe, but in whom the word is choked by worldly anxiety and the seduction of riches ( Matthew 13:22); (4) those who respond to the word and produce fruit abundantly ( Matthew 13:23)","9":"[24-30] This parable is peculiar to Matthew. The comparison in Matthew 13:24 does not mean that the kingdom of heaven may be likened simply to the person in question but to the situation narrated in the whole story. The refusal of the householder to allow his slaves to separate the wheat from the weeds while they are still growing is a warning to the disciples not to attempt to anticipate the final judgment of God by a definitive exclusion of sinners from the kingdom. In its present stage it is composed of the good and the bad. The judgment of God alone will eliminate the sinful. Until then there must be patience and the preaching of repentance","10":"[25] Weeds: darnel, a poisonous weed that in its first stage of growth resembles wheat","11":"[30] Harvest: a common biblical metaphor for the time of God's judgment; cf Jeremiah 51:33; Joel 3:13; Hosea 6:11","12":"[31-33] See Mark 4:30-32; Luke 13:18-21. The parables of the mustard seed and the yeast illustrate the same point: the amazing contrast between the small beginnings of the kingdom and its marvelous expansion","13":"[32] See Daniel 4:7-9, 17-19 where the birds nesting in the tree represent the people of Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom. See also Ezekiel 17:23; 31:6","14":"[33] Except in this Q parable and in Matthew 16:12, yeast (or \"leaven\") is, in New Testament usage, a symbol of corruption (see Matthew 16:6, 11-12; Mark 8:15; Luke 12:1; 1 Cor 5:6-8; Gal 5:9). Three measures: an enormous amount, enough to feed a hundred people. The exaggeration of this element of the parable points to the greatness of the kingdom's effect","15":"[34] Only in parables: see Matthew 13:10-15","16":"[35] The prophet: some textual witnesses read \"Isaiah the prophet.\" The quotation is actually from Psalm 78:2; the first line corresponds to the LXX text of the psalm. The psalm's title ascribes it to Asaph, the founder of one of the guilds of temple musicians. He is called \"the prophet\" (NAB \"the seer\") in 2 Chron 29:30 but it is doubtful that Matthew averted to that; for him, any Old Testament text that could be seen as fulfilled in Jesus was prophetic","17":"[36] Dismissing the crowds: the return of Jesus to the house marks a break with the crowds, who represent unbelieving Israel. From now on his attention is directed more and more to his disciples and to their instruction. The rest of the discourse is addressed to them alone","18":"[37-43] In the explanation of the parable of the weeds emphasis lies on the fearful end of the wicked, whereas the parable itself concentrates on patience with them until judgment time","19":"[38] The field is the world: this presupposes the resurrection of Jesus and the granting to him of \"all power in heaven and on earth\" ( Matthew 28:18)","20":"[39] The end of the age: this phrase is found only in Matthew ( 13:40, 49; 24:3; 28:20)","21":"[41] His kingdom: the kingdom of the Son of Man is distinguished from that of the Father ( Matthew 13:43); see 1 Cor 15:24-25. The church is the place where Jesus' kingdom is manifested, but his royal authority embraces the entire world; see the note on Matthew 13:38","22":"[43] See Daniel 12:3","23":"[44-50] The first two of the last three parables of the discourse have the same point. The person who finds a buried treasure and the merchant who finds a pearl of great price sell all that they have to acquire these finds; similarly, the one who understands the supreme value of the kingdom gives up whatever he must to obtain it. The joy with which this is done is made explicit in the first parable, but it may be presumed in the second also. The concluding parable of the fishnet resembles the explanation of the parable of the weeds with its stress upon the final exclusion of evil persons from the kingdom","24":"[44] In the unsettled conditions of Palestine in Jesus' time, it was not unusual to guard valuables by burying them in the ground","25":"[51] Matthew typically speaks of the understanding of the disciples","26":"[52] Since Matthew tends to identify the disciples and the Twelve (see the note on Matthew 10:1), this saying about the Christian scribe cannot be taken as applicable to all who accept the message of Jesus. While the Twelve are in many ways representative of all who believe in him, they are also distinguished from them in certain respects. The church of Matthew has leaders among whom are a group designated as \"scribes\" ( Matthew 23:34). Like the scribes of Israel, they are teachers. It is the Twelve and these their later counterparts to whom this verse applies. The scribe . . . instructed in the kingdom of heaven knows both the teaching of Jesus (the new) and the law and prophets (the old) and provides in his own teaching both the new and the old as interpreted and fulfilled by the new. On the translation head of a household (for the same Greek word translated householder in Matthew 13:27), see the note on Matthew 24:45-51","27":"[ 13:54- 17:27] This section is the narrative part of the fourth book of the gospel","28":"[54] After the Sermon on the Mount the crowds are in admiring astonishment at Jesus' teaching ( Matthew 7:28); here the astonishment is of those who take offense at him. Familiarity with his background and family leads them to regard him as pretentious. Matthew modifies his Marcan source ( Matthew 6:1-6). Jesus is not the carpenter but the carpenter's son ( Matthew 13:55), \"and among his own kin\" is omitted ( Matthew 13:57), he did not work many mighty deeds in face of such unbelief ( Matthew 13:58) rather than the Marcan \"... he was not able to perform any mighty deed there\" ( Matthew 6:5), and there is no mention of his amazement at his townspeople's lack of faith"}},"24":{"verses":{"1":{"verse":"Jesus left the temple area and was going away, when his disciples approached him to point out the temple buildings.","annotations":["1"]},"2":{"verse":"He said to them in reply, \"You see all these things, do you not?

It is called the \"escha tological\" discourse since it deals with the coming of the new age (the eschaton) in its fullness, with events that will precede it, and with how the disciples are to conduct themselves while awaiting an event that is as certain as its exact time is unknown to all but the Father ( Matthew 24:36). The discourse may be divided into two parts, Matthew 24:1-44 and Matthew 24:45- 25:46. In the first, Matthew follows his Marcan source ( Mark 13:1-37) closely. The second is drawn from Q and from the evangelist's own traditional material. Both parts show Matthew's editing of his sources by deletions, additions, and modifications. The vigilant waiting that is emphasized in the second part does not mean a cessation of ordinary activity and concentration only on what is to come, but a faithful accomplishment of duties at hand, with awareness that the end, for which the disciples must always be ready, will entail the great judgment by which the everlasting destiny of all will be determined.","2":"[2] As in Mark, Jesus predicts the destruction of the temple. By omitting the Marcan story of the widow's contribution ( Mark 12:41-44) that immediately precedes the prediction in that gospel, Matthew has established a close connection between it and Matthew 23:38, \". . . your house will be abandoned desolate.&quot","3":"[3] The Mount of Olives: see the note on Matthew 21:1. The disciples: cf Mark 13:3-4 where only Peter, James, John, and Andrew put the question that is answered by the discourse. In both gospels, however, the question is put privately: the ensuing discourse is only for those who are disciples of Jesus. When will this happen . . . end of the age?: Matthew distinguishes carefully between the destruction of the temple (this) and the coming of Jesus that will bring the end of the age. In Mark the two events are more closely connected, a fact that may be explained by Mark's believing that the one would immediately succeed the other. Coming: this translates the Greek word parousia, which is used in the gospels only here and in Matthew 24:27, 37, 39. It designated the official visit of a ruler to a city or the manifestation of a saving deity, and it was used by christians to refer to the final coming of Jesus in glory, a term first found in the New Testament with that meaning in 1 Thes 2:19. The end of the age: see the note on Matthew 13:39","4":"[4-14] This section of the discourse deals with calamities in the world ( Matthew 24:6-7) and in the church ( Matthew 24:9-12). The former must happen before the end comes ( Matthew 24:6), but they are only the beginning of the labor pains ( Matthew 24:8). (It may be noted that the Greek word translated the end in Matthew 24:6 and in Matthew 24:13-14 is not the same as the phrase \"the end of the age\" in Matthew 24:3 although the meaning is the same.) The latter are sufferings of the church, both from within and without, that will last until the gospel is preached . . . to all nations. Then the end will come and those who have endured the sufferings with fidelity will be saved ( Matthew 24:13-14)","5":"[6-7] The disturbances mentioned here are a commonplace of apocalyptic language, as is the assurance that they must happen (see Daniel 2:28 LXX), for that is the plan of God. Kingdom against kingdom: see Isaiah 19:2","6":"[8] The labor pains: the tribulations leading up to the end of the age are compared to the pains of a woman about to give birth. There is much attestation for rabbinic use of the phrase \"the woes (or birth pains) of the Messiah\" after the New Testament period, but in at least one instance it is attributed to a rabbi who lived in the late first century A.D. In this Jewish usage it meant the distress of the time preceding the coming of the Messiah; here, the labor pains precede the coming of the Son of Man in glory","7":"[9-12] Matthew has used Mark 13:9-12 in his missionary discourse ( Matthew 10:17-21) and omits it here. Besides the sufferings, including death, and the hatred of all nations that the disciples will have to endure, there will be worse affliction within the church itself. This is described in Matthew 24:10-12, which are peculiar to Matthew. Will be led into sin: literally, \"will be scandalized,\" probably meaning that they will become apostates; see Matthew 13:21 where \"fall away\" translates the same Greek word as here. Betray: in the Greek this is the same word as the hand over of Matthew 24:9. The handing over to persecution and hatred from outside will have their counterpart within the church. False prophets: these are Christians; see the note on Matthew 7:15-20. Evildoing: see Matthew 7:23. Because of the apocalyptic nature of much of this discourse, the literal meaning of this description of the church should not be pressed too hard. However, there is reason to think that Matthew's addition of these verses reflects in some measure the condition of his community","8":"[14] Except for the last part (and then the end will come), this verse substantially repeats Mark 13:10. The Matthean addition raises a problem since what follows in Matthew 24:15-23 refers to the horrors of the First Jewish Revolt including the destruction of the temple, and Matthew, writing after that time, knew that the parousia of Jesus was still in the future. A solution may be that the evangelist saw the events of those verses as foreshadowing the cosmic disturbances that he associates with the parousia ( Matthew 24:29) so that the period in which the former took place could be understood as belonging to the end","9":"[15-28] Cf Mark 13:14-23; Luke 17:23-24, 37. A further stage in the tribulations that will precede the coming of the Son of Man, and an answer to the question of Matthew 24:3a, \"when will this (the destruction of the temple) happen?&quot","10":"[15] The desolating abomination: in 167 B.C. the Syrian king Antiochus IV Epiphanes desecrated the temple by setting up in it a statue of Zeus Olympios (see 1 Macc 1:54). That event is referred to in Daniel 12:11 LXX as the \"desolating abomination\" (NAB \"horrible abomination\") and the same Greek term is used here; cf also Daniel 9:27; 11:31. Although the desecration had taken place before Dn was written, it is presented there as a future event, and Matthew sees that \"prophecy\" fulfilled in the desecration of the temple by the Romans. In the holy place: the temple; more precise than Mark's where he should not ( Mark 13:14). Let the reader understand: this parenthetical remark, taken from Mark 13:14 invites the reader to realize the meaning of Daniel's \"prophecy.&quot","11":"[16] The tradition that the Christians of Jerusalem fled from that city to Pella, a city of Transjordan, at the time of the First Jewish Revolt is found in Eusebius (Ecclesiastical History, 3, 5, 3), who attributes the flight to \"a certain oracle given by revelation before the war.\" The tradition is not improbable but the Matthean command, derived from its Marcan source, is vague in respect to the place of flight (to the mountains), although some scholars see it as applicable to the flight to Pella","12":"[17-19] Haste is essential, and the journey will be particularly difficult for women who are burdened with unborn or infant children","13":"[20] On the sabbath: this addition to in winter (cf Mark 13:18) has been understood as an indication that Matthew was addressed to a church still observing the Mosaic law of sabbath rest and the scribal limitations upon the length of journeys that might lawfully be made on that day. That interpretation conflicts with Matthew's view on sabbath observance (cf Matthew 12:1-14). The meaning of the addition may be that those undertaking on the sabbath a journey such as the one here ordered would be offending the sensibilities of law-observant Jews and would incur their hostility","14":"[21] For the unparalleled distress of that time, see Daniel 12:1","15":"[26-28] Claims that the Messiah is to be found in some distant or secret place must be ignored. The coming of the Son of Man will be as clear as lightning is to all and as the corpse of an animal is to vultures; cf Luke 17:24, 37. Here there is clear identification of the Son of Man and the Messiah; cf Matthew 24:23","16":"[29] The answer to the question of Matthew 24:3b \"What will be the sign of your coming?\" Immediately after . . . those days: the shortening of time between the preceding tribulation and the parousia has been explained as Matthew's use of a supposed device of Old Testament prophecy whereby certainty that a predicted event will occur is expressed by depicting it as imminent. While it is questionable that that is an acceptable understanding of the Old Testament predictions, it may be applicable here, for Matthew knew that the parousia had not come immediately after the fall of Jerusalem, and it is unlikely that he is attributing a mistaken calculation of time to Jesus. The sun . . . be shaken: cf Isaiah 13:10, 13","17":"[30] The sign of the Son of Man: perhaps this means the sign that is the glorious appearance of the Son of Man; cf Matthew 12:39-40 where \"the sign of Jonah\" is Jonah's being in the \"belly of the whale.\" Tribes of the earth will mourn: peculiar to Matthew; cf Zechariah 12:12-14. Coming upon the clouds . . . glory: cf Daniel 7:13 although there the \"one like a son of man\" comes to God to receive kingship; here the Son of Man comes from heaven for judgment","18":"[31] Send out his angels: cf Matthew 13:41 where they are sent out to collect the wicked for punishment. Trumpet blast: cf Isaiah 27:13; 1 Thes 4:16","19":"[32-35] Cf Mark 13:28-31","20":"[34] The difficulty raised by this verse cannot be satisfactorily removed by the supposition that this generation means the Jewish people throughout the course of their history, much less the entire human race. Perhaps for Matthew it means the generation to which he and his community belonged","21":"[36-44] The statement of Matthew 24:34 is now counterbalanced by one that declares that the exact time of the parousia is known only to the Father ( Matthew 24:36), and the disciples are warned to be always ready for it. This section is drawn from Mark and Q (cf Luke 17:26-27, 34-35; 12:39-40)","22":"[36] Many textual witnesses omit nor the Son, which follows Mark 13:32. Since its omission can be explained by reluctance to attribute this ignorance to the Son, the reading that includes it is probably original","23":"[37-39] Cf Luke 17:26-27. In the days of Noah: the Old Testament account of the flood lays no emphasis upon what is central for Matthew, i.e., the unexpected coming of the flood upon those who were unprepared for it","24":"[40-41] Cf Luke 17:34-35. Taken . . . left: the former probably means taken into the kingdom; the latter, left for destruction. People in the same situation will be dealt with in opposite ways. In this context, the discrimination between them will be based on their readiness for the coming of the Son of Man","25":"[42-44] Cf Luke 12:39-40. The theme of vigilance and readiness is continued with the bold comparison of the Son of Man to a thief who comes to break into a house","26":"[45-51] The second part of the discourse (see the note on Matthew 24:1- 25:46) begins with this parable of the faithful or unfaithful servant; cf Luke 12:41-46. It is addressed to the leaders of Matthew's church; the servant has been put in charge of his master's household ( Matthew 24:45) even though that household is composed of those who are his fellow servants ( Matthew 24:49)","27":"[45] To distribute . . . proper time: readiness for the master's return means a vigilance that is accompanied by faithful performance of the duty assigned","28":"[48] My master . . . delayed: the note of delay is found also in the other parables of this section; cf Matthew 25:5, 19","29":"[51] Punish him severely: the Greek verb, found in the New Testament only here and in the Lucan parallel ( Luke 12:46), means, literally, \"cut in two.\" With the hypocrites: see the note on Matthew 6:2.

Consisting of a genealogy and five stories, it presents the coming of Jesus as the climax of Israel's history, and the events of his conception, birth, and early childhood as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy. The genealogy is probably traditional material that Matthew edited. In its first two sections ( Matthew 1:2-11) it was drawn from Ruth 4:18-22; 1 Chron 1-3. Except for Jechoniah, Shealtiel, and Zerubbabel, none of the names in the third section ( Matthew 1:12-16) is found in any Old Testament genealogy. While the genealogy shows the continuity of God's providential plan from Abraham on, discontinuity is also present. The women Tamar ( Matthew 1:3), Rahab and Ruth ( Matthew 1:5), and the wife of Uriah, Bathsheba ( Matthew 1:6), bore their sons through unions that were in varying degrees strange and unexpected. These \"irregularities\" culminate in the supreme \"irregularity\" of the Messiah's birth of a virgin mother; the age of fulfillment is inaugurated by a creative act of God. Drawing upon both biblical tradition and Jewish stories, Matthew portrays Jesus as reliving the Exodus experience of Israel and the persecutions of Moses. His rejection by his own people and his passion are foreshadowed by the troubled reaction of \"all Jerusalem\" to the question of the magi who are seeking the \"newborn king of the Jews\" ( Matthew 2:2-3), and by Herod's attempt to have him killed. The magi who do him homage prefigure the Gentiles who will accept the preaching of the gospel. The infancy narrative proclaims who Jesus is, the savior of his people from their sins ( Matthew 1:21), Emmanuel in whom \"God is with us\" ( Matthew 1:23), and the Son of God ( Matthew 2:15)","2":"[1] The Son of David, the son of Abraham: two links of the genealogical chain are singled out. Although the later, David is placed first in order to emphasize that Jesus is the royal Messiah. The mention of Abraham may be due not only to his being the father of the nation Israel but to Matthew's interest in the universal scope of Jesus' mission; cf Genesis 22:18 \". . . . in your descendants all the nations of the earth shall find blessing.\"","3":"[7] The successor of Abijah was not Asaph but Asa (see 1 Chron 3:10). Some textual witnesses read the latter name; however, Asaph is better attested. Matthew may have deliberately introduced the psalmist Asaph into the genealogy (and in Matthew 1:10 the prophet Amos) in order to show that Jesus is the fulfillment not only of the promises made to David (see 2 Sam 7) but of all the Old Testament","4":"[10] Amos: some textual witnesses read Amon, who was the actual successor of Manasseh (see 1 Chron 3:14)","5":"[17] Matthew is concerned with fourteen generations, probably because fourteen is the numerical value of the Hebrew letters forming the name of David. In the second section of the genealogy ( Matthew 1:6b-11), three kings of Judah, Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah, have been omitted (see 1 Chron 3:11-12), so that there are fourteen generations in that section. Yet the third ( Matthew 1:12-16) apparently has only thirteen. Since Matthew here emphasizes that each section has fourteen, it is unlikely that the thirteen of the last was due to his oversight. Some scholars suggest that Jesus who is called the Messiah ( Matthew 1:16b) doubles the final member of the chain: Jesus, born within the family of David, opens up the new age as Messiah, so that in fact there are fourteen generations in the third section. This is perhaps too subtle, and the hypothesis of a slip not on the part of Matthew but of a later scribe seems likely. On Messiah, see the note on Luke 2:11","6":"[18-25] This first story of the infancy narrative spells out what is summarily indicated in Matthew 1:16. The virginal conception of Jesus is the work of the Spirit of God. Joseph's decision to divorce Mary is overcome by the heavenly command that he take her into his home and accept the child as his own. The natural genealogical line is broken but the promises to David are fulfilled; through Joseph's adoption the child belongs to the family of David. Matthew sees the virginal conception as the fulfillment of Isaiah 7:14","7":"[18] Betrothed to Joseph: betrothal was the first part of the marriage, constituting a man and woman as husband and wife. Subsequent infidelity was considered adultery. The betrothal was followed some months later by the husband's taking his wife into his home, at which time normal married life began","8":"[19] A righteous man: as a devout observer of the Mosaic law, Joseph wished to break his union with someone whom he suspected of gross violation of the law. It is commonly said that the law required him to do so, but the texts usually given in support of that view, e.g., Deut 22:20-21 do not clearly pertain to Joseph's situation. Unwilling to expose her to shame: the penalty for proved adultery was death by stoning; cf Deut 22:21-23","9":"[20] The angel of the Lord: in the Old Testament a common designation of God in communication with a human being. In a dream: see Matthew 2:13, 19, 22. These dreams may be meant to recall the dreams of Joseph, son of Jacob the patriarch ( Genesis 37:5- 11:19). A closer parallel is the dream of Amram, father of Moses, related by Josephus (Antiquities 2,9,3; 212, 215-16)","10":"[21] Jesus: in first-century Judaism the Hebrew name Joshua (Greek Iesous) meaning \"Yahweh helps\" was interpreted as \"Yahweh saves.&quot","11":"[23] God is with us: God's promise of deliverance to Judah in Isaiah's time is seen by Matthew as fulfilled in the birth of Jesus, in whom God is with his people. The name Emmanuel is alluded to at the end of the gospel where the risen Jesus assures his disciples of his continued presence,\". . . I am with you always, until the end of the age\" ( Matthew 28:20)","12":"[25] Until she bore a son: the evangelist is concerned to emphasize that Joseph was not responsible for the conception of Jesus.

A high mountain: this has been identified with Tabor or Hermon, but probably no specific mountain was intended by the evangelist or by his Marcan source ( Matthew 9:2).

The command to listen to Jesus is general, but in this context it probably applies particularly to the preceding predictions of his passion and resurrection ( Matthew 16:21) and of his coming ( Matthew 16:27, 28)","7":"[6-7] A Matthean addition; cf Daniel 10:9-10, 18-19","8":"[9] In response to the disciples' question about the expected return of Elijah, Jesus interprets the mission of the Baptist as the fulfillment of that expectation. But that was not suspected by those who opposed and finally killed him, and Jesus predicts a similar fate for himself","9":"[9] The vision: Matthew alone uses this word to describe the transfiguration. Until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead: only in the light of Jesus' resurrection can the meaning of his life and mission be truly understood; until then no testimony to the vision will lead people to faith. Matthew 17:9-1","10":"[10] See the notes on Matthew 3:4; 16:14","11":"[11-12] The preceding question and this answer may reflect later controversy with Jews who objected to the Christian claims for Jesus that Elijah had not yet come","12":"[13] See Matthew 11:14","13":"[14-20] Matthew has greatly shortened the Marcan story ( Matthew 9:14-29). Leaving aside several details of the boy's illness, he concentrates on the need for faith, not so much on the part of the boy's father (as does Mark, for Matthew omits Mark 9:22b-24) but on that of his own disciples whose inability to drive out the demon is ascribed to their little faith ( Matthew 17:20)","14":"[15] A lunatic: this description of the boy is peculiar to Matthew. The word occurs in the New Testament only here and in Matthew 4:24 and means one affected or struck by the moon. The symptoms of the boy's illness point to epilepsy, and attacks of this were thought to be caused by phases of the moon","15":"[17] Faithless and perverse: so Matthew and Luke (Matthew 9:41) against Mark's faithless ( Matthew 9:19). The Greek word here translated perverse is the same as that in Deut 32:5 LXX, where Moses speaks to his people. There is a problem in knowing to whom the reproach is addressed. Since the Matthean Jesus normally chides his disciples for their little faith (as in Matthew 17:20), it would appear that the charge of lack of faith could not be made against them and that the reproach is addressed to unbelievers among the Jews. However in Matthew 17:20b (if you have faith the size of a mustard seed), which is certainly addressed to the disciples, they appear to have not even the smallest faith; if they had, they would have been able to cure the boy. In the light of Matthew 17:20b the reproach of Matthew 17:17 could have applied to the disciples. There seems to be an inconsistency between the charge of little faith in Matthew 17:20a and that of not even a little in Matthew 17:20b","16":"[18] The demon came out of him: not until this verse does Matthew indicate that the boy's illness is a case of demoniacal possession","17":"[20] The entire verse is an addition of Matthew who (according to the better attested text) omits the reason given for the disciples' inability in Mark 9:29. Little faith: see the note on Matthew 6, 30. Faith the size of a mustard seed . . . and it will move: a combination of a Q saying (cf Luke 17:6) with a Marcan saying (cf Mark 11:23)","18":"[21] Some manuscripts add, \"But this kind does not come out except by prayer and fasting\"; this is a variant of the better reading of Mark 9:29","19":"[22-23] The second passion prediction (cf Matthew 16:21-23) is the least detailed of the three and may be the earliest. In the Marcan parallel the disciples do not understand ( Matthew 9:32); here they understand and are overwhelmed with grief at the prospect of Jesus' death ( Matthew 17:23)","20":"[24-27] Like Matthew 14:28-31 and Matthew 16:16b-19, this episode comes from Matthew's special material on Peter. Although the question of the collectors concerns Jesus' payment of the temple tax, it is put to Peter. It is he who receives instruction from Jesus about freedom from the obligation of payment and yet why it should be made. The means of doing so is provided miraculously. The pericope deals with a problem of Matthew's church, whether its members should pay the temple tax, and the answer is given through a word of Jesus conveyed to Peter. Some scholars see here an example of the teaching authority of Peter exercised in the name of Jesus (see Matthew 16:19). The specific problem was a Jewish Christian one and may have arisen when the Matthean church was composed largely of that group","21":"[24] The temple tax: before the destruction of the Jerusalem temple in A.D. 70 every male Jew above nineteen years of age was obliged to make an annual contribution to its upkeep (cf Exodus 30:11-16; Nehemiah 10:33). After the destruction the Romans imposed upon Jews the obligation of paying that tax for the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. There is disagreement about which period the story deals with","22":"[25] From their subjects or from foreigners?: the Greek word here translated subjects literally means \"sons.&quot","23":"[26] Then the subjects are exempt: just as subjects are not bound by laws applying to foreigners, neither are Jesus and his disciples, who belong to the kingdom of heaven, bound by the duty of paying the temple tax imposed on those who are not of the kingdom. If the Greek is translated \"sons,\" the freedom of Jesus, the Son of God, and of his disciples, children (\"sons\") of the kingdom (cf Matthew 13:38), is even more clear","24":"[27] That we may not offend them: though they are exempt ( Matthew 17:26), Jesus and his disciples are to avoid giving offense; therefore the tax is to be paid. A coin worth twice the temple tax: literally, \"a stater,\" a Greek coin worth two double drachmas. Two double drachmas were equal to the Jewish shekel and the tax was a half-shekel. For me and for you: not only Jesus but Peter pays the tax, and this example serves as a standard for the conduct of all the disciples"}},"7":{"verses":{"1":{"verse":"\"Stop judging, that you may not be judged.","annotations":["1","2"]},"2":{"verse":"For as you judge, so will you be judged, and the measure with which you measure will be measured out to you.","annotations":[]},"3":{"verse":"Why do you notice the splinter in your brother's eye, but do not perceive the wooden beam in your own eye?","annotations":[]},"4":{"verse":"How can you say to your brother, 'Let me remove that splinter from your eye,' while the wooden beam is in your eye?","annotations":[]},"5":{"verse":"You hypocrite, remove the wooden beam from your eye first; then you will see clearly to remove the splinter from your brother's eye.","annotations":["3"]},"6":{"verse":"\"Do not give what is holy to dogs, or throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them underfoot, and turn and tear you to pieces.","annotations":["4"]},"7":{"verse":"\"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.","annotations":[]},"8":{"verse":"For everyone who asks, receives; and the one who seeks, finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.","annotations":[]},"9":{"verse":"Which one of you would hand his son a stone when he asks for a loaf of bread,","annotations":["5"]},"10":{"verse":"or a snake when he asks for a fish?","annotations":[]},"11":{"verse":"If you then, who are wicked, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good things to those who ask him.","annotations":[]},"12":{"verse":"\"Do to others whatever you would have them do to you.

The criterion of judgment will be the deeds of mercy that have been done for the least of Jesus' brothers ( Matthew 25:40). A difficult and important question is the identification of these least brothers. Are they all people who have suffered hunger, thirst, etc. ( Matthew 25:35, 36) or a particular group of such sufferers? Scholars are divided in their response and arguments can be made for either side. But leaving aside the problem of what the traditional material that Matthew edited may have meant, it seems that a stronger case can be made for the view that in the evangelist's sense the sufferers are Christians, probably Christian missionaries whose sufferings were brought upon them by their preaching of the gospel. The criterion of judgment for all the nations is their treatment of those who have borne to the world the message of Jesus, and this means ultimately their acceptance or rejection of Jesus himself; cf Matthew 10:40, \"Whoever receives you, receives me.&quot","15":"[32] All the nations: before the end the gospel will have been preached throughout the world ( Matthew 24:14); thus the Gentiles will be judged on their response to it.

The expression \"the kingdom of heaven\" occurs only in the gospel of Matthew. It means the effective rule of God over his people. In its fullness it includes not only human obedience to God's word, but the triumph of God over physical evils, supremely over death. In the expectation found in Jewish apocalyptic, the kingdom was to be ushered in by a judgment in which sinners would be condemned and perish, an expectation shared by the Baptist.

The Sadducees were the priestly aristocratic party, centered in Jerusalem. They accepted as scripture only the first five books of the Old Testament, followed only the letter of the law, rejected the oral legal traditions, and were opposed to teachings not found in the Pentateuch, such as the resurrection of the dead. Matthew links both of these groups together as enemies of Jesus ( Matthew 16:1, 6, 11, 12; cf Mark 8:11-13, 15).

His reluctance to admit Jesus among the sinners whom he is baptizing with water is overcome by Jesus' response. To fulfill all righteousness: in this gospel to fulfill usually refers to fulfillment of prophecy, and righteousness to moral conduct in conformity with God's will. Here, however, as in Matthew 5:6; 6:33, righteousness seems to mean the saving activity of God. To fulfill all righteousness is to submit to the plan of God for the salvation of the human race.

It deals with the mission now to be undertaken by the disciples ( Matthew 10:5-15), but the perspective broadens and includes the missionary activity of the church between the time of the resurrection and the parousia","2":"His twelve disciples: although, unlike Mark ( Mark 3:13-14) and Luke ( Luke 6:12-16), Matthew has no story of Jesus' choosing the Twelve, he assumes that the group is known to the reader. The earliest New Testament text to speak of it is 1 Cor 15:5. The number probably is meant to recall the twelve tribes of Israel and implies Jesus' authority to call all Israel into the kingdom. While Luke ( Luke 6:13) and probably Mark ( Mark 4:10, 34) distinguish between the Twelve and a larger group also termed disciples, Matthew tends to identify the disciples and the Twelve. Authority . . . every illness: activities the same as those of Jesus; see Matthew 4:23; Matthew 9:35; 10:8. The Twelve also share in his proclamation of the kingdom ( Matthew 10:7). But although he teaches ( Matthew 4:23; 7:28; 9:35), they do not. Their commission to teach comes only after Jesus' resurrection, after they have been fully instructed by him ( Matthew 28:20).","3":"[2-4] Here, for the only time in Matthew, the Twelve are designated apostles. The word \"apostle\" means \"one who is sent,\" and therefore fits the situation here described. In the Pauline letters, the place where the term occurs most frequently in the New Testament, it means primarily one who has seen the risen Lord and has been commissioned to proclaim the resurrection. With slight variants in Luke and Acts, the names of those who belong to this group are the same in the four lists given in the New Testament (see the note on Matthew 9:9). Cananean: this represents an Aramaic word meaning \"zealot.\" The meaning of that designation is unclear (see the note on Luke 6:15)","4":"[5-6] Like Jesus ( Matthew 15:24), the Twelve are sent only to Israel. This saying may reflect an original Jewish Christian refusal of the mission to the Gentiles, but for Matthew it expresses rather the limitation that Jesus himself observed during his ministry","5":"[8-11] The Twelve have received their own call and mission through God's gift, and the benefits they confer are likewise to be given freely. They are not to take with them money, provisions, or unnecessary clothing; their lodging and food will be provided by those who receive them","6":"[13] The greeting of peace is conceived of not merely as a salutation but as an effective word.

Here Matthew brings into the discourse sayings found in Mark 13 which deals with events preceding the parousia","9":"[21] See Micah 7:6 which is cited in Matthew 10:35, 36","10":"[22] To the end: the original meaning was probably \"until the parousia.\" But it is not likely that Matthew expected no missionary disciples to suffer death before then, since he envisages the martyrdom of other Christians ( Matthew 10:21). For him, the end is probably that of the individual's life (see Matthew 10:28)","11":"[23] Before the Son of Man comes: since the coming of the Son of Man at the end of the age had not taken place when this gospel was written, much less during the mission of the Twelve during Jesus' ministry, Matthew cannot have meant the coming to refer to the parousia. It is difficult to know what he understood it to be: perhaps the \"proleptic parousia\" of Matthew 28:16-20, or the destruction of the temple in A.D. 70, viewed as a coming of Jesus in judgment on unbelieving Israel","12":"[25] Beelzebul: see Matthew 9:34 for the charge linking Jesus with \"the prince of demons,\" who is named Beelzebul in Matthew 12:24. The meaning of the name is uncertain; possibly, \"lord of the house.&quot","13":"[26] The concealed and secret coming of the kingdom is to be proclaimed by them, and no fear must be allowed to deter them from that proclamation","14":"[32-33] In the Q parallel ( Luke 12:8-9), the Son of Man will acknowledge those who have acknowledged Jesus, and those who deny him will be denied (by the Son of Man) before the angels of God at the judgment. Here Jesus and the Son of Man are identified, and the acknowledgment or denial will be before his heavenly Father","15":"[38] The first mention of the cross in Matthew, explicitly that of the disciple, but implicitly that of Jesus (and follow after me). Crucifixion was a form of capital punishment used by the Romans for offenders who were not Roman citizens","16":"[39] One who denies Jesus in order to save one's earthly life will be condemned to everlasting destruction; loss of earthly life for Jesus' sake will be rewarded by everlasting life in the kingdom","17":"[40-42] All who receive the disciples of Jesus receive him, and God who sent him, and will be rewarded accordingly","18":"[41] A prophet: one who speaks in the name of God; here, the Christian prophets who proclaim the gospel. Righteous man: since righteousness is demanded of all the disciples, it is difficult to take the righteous man of this verse and one of these little ones ( Matthew 10:42) as indicating different groups within the followers of Jesus.

The testings of Jesus resemble those of Israel during the wandering in the desert and later in Canaan, and the victory of Jesus, the true Israel and the true Son, contrasts with the failure of the ancient and disobedient \"son,\" the old Israel.

In order to accommodate Jesus' move to Capernaum to the prophecy, Matthew speaks of that town as being \"in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali\" ( Matthew 4:13), whereas it was only in the territory of the latter, and he understands the sea of the prophecy, the Mediterranean, as the sea of Galilee","7":"[17] At the beginning of his preaching Jesus takes up the words of John the Baptist ( Matthew 3:2) although with a different meaning; in his ministry the kingdom of heaven has already begun to be present ( Matthew 12:28)","8":"[18-22] The call of the first disciples promises them a share in Jesus' work and entails abandonment of family and former way of life.

Beginning with the warning that greatness in the kingdom of heaven is measured not by rank or power but by childlikeness ( Matthew 18:1-5), it deals with the care that the disciples must take not to cause the little ones to sin or to neglect them if they stray from the community ( Matthew 18:6-14), the correction of members who sin ( Matthew 18:15-18), the efficacy of the prayer of the disciples because of the presence of Jesus ( Matthew 18:19-20), and the forgiveness that must be repeatedly extended to sinful members who repent ( Matthew 18:21-35)","2":"[1] The initiative is taken not by Jesus as in the Marcan parallel ( Mark 9:33-34) but by the disciples. Kingdom of heaven: this may mean the kingdom in its fullness, i.e., after the parousia and the final judgment. But what follows about causes of sin, church discipline, and forgiveness, all dealing with the present age, suggests that the question has to do with rank also in the church, where the kingdom is manifested here and now, although only partially and by anticipation; see the notes on Matthew 3:2; 4:17.","3":"[3] Become like children: the child is held up as a model for the disciples not because of any supposed innocence of children but because of their complete dependence on, and trust in, their parents. So must the disciples be, in respect to God","4":"[5] Cf Matthew 10:40","5":"[6] One of these little ones: the thought passes from the child of Matthew 18:2-4 to the disciples, little ones because of their becoming like children. It is difficult to know whether this is a designation of all who are disciples or of those who are insignificant in contrast to others, e.g., the leaders of the community. Since apart from this chapter the designation little ones occurs in Matthew only in Matthew 10:42 where it means disciples as such, that is its more likely meaning here. Who believe in me: since discipleship is impossible without at least some degree of faith, this further specification seems superfluous. However, it serves to indicate that the warning against causing a little one to sin is principally directed against whatever would lead such a one to a weakening or loss of faith. The Greek verb skandalizein, here translated causes . . . to sin, means literally \"causes to stumble\"; what the stumbling is depends on the context. It is used of falling away from faith in Matthew 13:21. According to the better reading of Mark 9:42, in me is a Matthean addition to the Marcan source. It would be better . . . depths of the sea: cf Mark 9:42","6":"[7] This is a Q saying; cf Luke 17:1. The inevitability of things that cause sin (literally, \"scandals\") does not take away the responsibility of the one through whom they come. Matthew 18:8-","7":"[8] These verses are a doublet of Matthew 5:29-30. In that context they have to do with causes of sexual sin. As in the Marcan source from which they have been drawn ( Mark 9:42-48), they differ from the first warning about scandal, which deals with causing another person to sin, for they concern what causes oneself to sin and they do not seem to be related to another's loss of faith, as the first warning is. It is difficult to know how Matthew understood the logical connection between these verses and Matthew 18:6-7","8":"[10-14] The first and last verses are peculiar to Matthew. The parable itself comes from Q; see Luke 15:3-7. In Luke it serves as justification for Jesus' table-companionship with sinners; here, it is an exhortation for the disciples to seek out fellow disciples who have gone astray. Not only must no one cause a fellow disciple to sin, but those who have strayed must be sought out and, if possible, brought back to the community. The joy of the shepherd on finding the sheep, though not absent in Matthew 18:13 is more emphasized in Luke. By his addition of Matthew 18:10, 14 Matthew has drawn out explicitly the application of the parable to the care of the little ones","9":"[10] Their angels in heaven . . . my heavenly Father: for the Jewish belief in angels as guardians of nations and individuals, see Daniel 10:13, 20-21; Tobit 5:4-7; 1QH 5:20-22; as intercessors who present the prayers of human beings to God, see Tobit 13:12, 15. The high worth of the little ones is indicated by their being represented before God by these heavenly beings","10":"[11] Some manuscripts add, \"For the Son of Man has come to save what was lost\"; cf Matthew 9:13. This is practically identical with Luke 19:10 and is probably a copyist's addition from that source","11":"[15-20] Passing from the duty of Christian disciples toward those who have strayed from their number, the discourse now turns to how they are to deal with one who sins and yet remains within the community. First there is to be private correction ( Matthew 18:15); if this is unsuccessful, further correction before two or three witnesses ( Matthew 18:16); if this fails, the matter is to be brought before the assembled community (the church), and if the sinner refuses to attend to the correction of the church, he is to be expelled ( Matthew 18:17). The church's judgment will be ratified in heaven, i.e., by God ( Matthew 18:18). This three-step process of correction corresponds, though not exactly, to the procedure of the Qumran community; see 1QS 5:25-6:1; 6:24-7:25; CD 9:2-8. The section ends with a saying about the favorable response of God to prayer, even to that of a very small number, for Jesus is in the midst of any gathering of his disciples, however small ( Matthew 18:19-20). Whether this prayer has anything to do with the preceding judgment is uncertain","12":"[15] Your brother: a fellow disciple; see Matthew 23:8. The bracketed words, against you, are widely attested but they are not in the important codices Sinaiticus and Vaticanus or in some other textual witnesses. Their omission broadens the type of sin in question. Won over: literally, \"gained.&quot","13":"[16] Cf Deut 19:15","14":"[17] The church: the second of the only two instances of this word in the gospels; see the note on Matthew 16:18. Here it refers not to the entire church of Jesus, as in Matthew 16:18, but to the local congregation. Treat him . . . a Gentile or a tax collector: just as the observant Jew avoided the company of Gentiles and tax collectors, so must the congregation of Christian disciples separate itself from the arrogantly sinful member who refuses to repent even when convicted of his sin by the whole church. Such a one is to be set outside the fellowship of the community. The harsh language about Gentile and tax collector probably reflects a stage of the Matthean church when it was principally composed of Jewish Christians. That time had long since passed, but the principle of exclusion for such a sinner remained. Paul makes a similar demand for excommunication in 1 Cor 5:1-13","15":"[18] Except for the plural of the verbs bind and loose, this verse is practically identical with Matthew 16:19b and many scholars understand it as granting to all the disciples what was previously given to Peter alone. For a different view, based on the different contexts of the two verses, see the note on Matthew 16:19","16":"[19-20] Some take these verses as applying to prayer on the occasion of the church's gathering to deal with the sinner of Matthew 18:17. Unless an a fortiori argument is supposed, this seems unlikely. God's answer to the prayer of two or three envisages a different situation from one that involves the entire congregation. In addition, the object of this prayer is expressed in most general terms as anything for which they are to pray","17":"[20] For where two or three . . . midst of them: the presence of Jesus guarantees the efficacy of the prayer. This saying is similar to one attributed to a rabbi executed in A.D. 135 at the time of the second Jewish revolt: \". . . When two sit and there are between them the words of the Torah, the divine presence (Shekinah) rests upon them\" (Pirqe Abot 3:3)","18":"[21-35] The final section of the discourse deals with the forgiveness that the disciples are to give to their fellow disciples who sin against them. To the question of Peter how often forgiveness is to be granted ( Matthew 18:21), Jesus answers that it is to be given without limit ( Matthew 18:22) and illustrates this with the parable of the unmerciful servant ( Matthew 18:23-34), warning that his heavenly Father will give those who do not forgive the same treatment as that given to the unmerciful servant ( Matthew 18:35). Matthew 18:21-22 correspond to Luke 17:4; the parable and the final warning are peculiar to Matthew. That the Parable did not originally belong to this context is suggested by the fact that it really does not deal with repeated forgiveness, which is the point of Peter's question and Jesus' reply","19":"[22] Seventy-seven times: the Greek corresponds exactly to the LXX of Genesis 4:24. There is probably an allusion, by contrast, to the limitless vengeance of Lamech in the Genesis text. In any case, what is demanded of the disciples is limitless forgiveness","20":"[24] A huge amount: literally, \"ten thousand talents.\" The talent was a unit of coinage of high but varying value depending on its metal (gold, silver, copper) and its place of origin. It is mentioned in the New Testament only here and in Matthew 25:14-30","21":"[26] Pay you back in full: an empty promise, given the size of the debt","22":"[28] A much smaller amount: literally, \"a hundred denarii.\" A denarius was the normal daily wage of a laborer. The difference between the two debts is enormous and brings out the absurdity of the conduct of the Christian who has received the great forgiveness of God and yet refuses to forgive the relatively minor offenses done to him","23":"[34] Since the debt is so great as to be unpayable, the punishment will be endless","24":"[35] The Father's forgiveness, already given, will be withdrawn at the final judgment for those who have not imitated his forgiveness by their own"}},"20":{"verses":{"1":{"verse":"\"The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out at dawn to hire laborers for his vineyard.","annotations":["1"]},"2":{"verse":"After agreeing with them for the usual daily wage, he sent them into his vineyard.","annotations":[]},"3":{"verse":"Going out about nine o'clock, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace,","annotations":[]},"4":{"verse":"and he said to them, 'You too go into my vineyard, and I will give you what is just.'","annotations":["2"]},"5":{"verse":"So they went off.

This is the third and the most detailed of the passion predictions ( Matthew 16:21-23; 17:22-23). It speaks of Jesus' being \"handed over to the Gentiles\" ( Matthew 27:2), his being \"mocked\" ( Matthew 27:27-30), \"scourged\" ( Matthew 27:26), and \"crucified\" ( Matthew 27:31, 35). In all but the last of these points Matthew agrees with his Marcan source, but whereas Mark speaks of Jesus' being killed ( Mark 10:34), Matthew has the specific \"to be . . . crucified.&quot","8":"[20-28] Cf Mark 10:35-45. The request of the sons of Zebedee, made through their mother, for the highest places of honor in the kingdom, and the indignation of the other ten disciples at this request, show that neither the two brothers nor the others have understood that what makes for greatness in the kingdom is not lordly power but humble service. Jesus gives the example, and his ministry of service will reach its highest point when he gives his life for the deliverance of the human race from sin","9":"[20-21] The reason for Matthew's making the mother the petitioner (cf Mark 10:35) is not clear. Possibly he intends an allusion to Bathsheba's seeking the kingdom for Solomon; see 1 Kings 1:11-21. Your kingdom: see the note on Matthew 16:28","10":"[22] You do not know what you are asking: the Greek verbs are plural and, with the rest of the verse, indicate that the answer is addressed not to the woman but to her sons. Drink the cup: see the note on Mark 10:38-40. Matthew omits the Marcan \"or be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized\" ( Matthew 10:38)","11":"[28] Ransom: this noun, which occurs in the New Testament only here and in the Marcan parallel (Matthew 10:45), does not necessarily express the idea of liberation by payment of some price. The cognate verb is used frequently in the LXX of God's liberating Israel from Egypt or from Babylonia after the Exile; see Exodus 6:6; 15:13; Psalm 77:16 (76 LXX); Isaiah 43:1; 44:22. The liberation brought by Jesus' death will be for many; cf Isaiah 53:12. Many does not mean that some are excluded, but is a Semitism designating the collectivity who benefit from the service of the one, and is equivalent to \"all.\" While there are few verbal contacts between this saying and the fourth Servant Song ( Isaiah 52:13- 53:12), the ideas of that passage are reflected here","12":"[29-34] The cure of the blind men is probably symbolic of what will happen to the disciples, now blind to the meaning of Jesus' passion and to the necessity of their sharing his suffering. As the men are given sight, so, after the resurrection, will the disciples come to see that to which they are now blind. Matthew has abbreviated his Marcan source (Matthew 10:46-52) and has made Mark's one man two. Such doubling is characteristic of this gospel; see Matthew 8:28-34 ( Mark 5:1-20) and the note on Matthew 9:27-31","13":"[30] [Lord]: some important textual witnesses omit this, but that may be because copyists assimilated this verse to Matthew 9:27.

Matthew's extension to human beings of the authority to forgive sins points to the belief that such authority was being claimed by Matthew's church","5":"[9-17] In this section the order is the same as that of Mark 2:13-22","6":"[9] A man named Matthew: Mark names this tax collector Levi ( Mark 2:14). No such name appears in the four lists of the twelve who were the closest companions of Jesus ( Matthew 10:2-4; Mark 3:16-19; Luke 6:14-16; Acts 1:13 [eleven, because of the defection of Judas Iscariot]), whereas all four list a Matthew, designated in Matthew 10:3 as \"the tax collector.\" The evangelist may have changed the \"Levi\" of his source to Matthew so that this man, whose call is given special notice, like that of the first four disciples ( Matthew 4:18-22), might be included among the twelve. Another reason for the change may be that the disciple Matthew was the source of traditions peculiar to the church for which the evangelist was writing","7":"[10] His house: it is not clear whether his refers to Jesus or Matthew.

Though it tells of two miracles, the cure of the woman had already been included within the story of the raising of the official's daughter, so that the two were probably regarded as a single unit. The other miracles seem to have been derived from Mark and Q respectively, though there Matthew's own editing is much more evident","14":"[18] Official: literally, \"ruler.\" Mark calls him \"one of the synagogue officials\" ( Mark 5:22). My daughter has just died: Matthew heightens the Marcan \"my daughter is at the point of death\" ( Mark 5:23)","15":"[20] Tassel: possibly \"fringe.\" The Mosaic law prescribed that tassels be worn on the corners of one's garment as a reminder to keep the commandments (see Numbers 15:37-39; Deut 22:12)","16":"[24] Sleeping: sleep is a biblical metaphor for death (see Psalm 87:6 LXX; Daniel 12:2; 1 Thes 5:10). Jesus' statement is not a denial of the child's real death, but an assurance that she will be roused from her sleep of death","17":"[27-31] This story was probably composed by Matthew out of Mark's story of the healing of a blind man named Bartimaeus ( Mark 10:46-52). Mark places the event late in Jesus' ministry, just before his entrance into Jerusalem, and Matthew has followed his Marcan source at that point in his gospel also (see Matthew 20:29-34). In each of the Matthean stories the single blind man of Mark becomes two. The reason why Matthew would have given a double version of the Marcan story and placed the earlier one here may be that he wished to add a story of Jesus' curing the blind at this point in order to prepare for Jesus' answer to the emissaries of the Baptist ( Matthew 11:4-6) in which Jesus, recounting his works, begins with his giving sight to the blind","18":"[27] Son of David: this messianic title is connected once with the healing power of Jesus in Mark ( Mark 10:47-48) and Luke ( Luke 18:38-39) but more frequently in Matthew (see also Matthew 12:23; 15:22; 20:30-31)","19":"[32-34] The source of this story seems to be Q (see Luke 11:14-15).

In his passion narrative ( Matthew 26:26-27) Matthew follows his Marcan source closely but with omissions (e.g., Mark 14:51-52) and additions (e.g., Matthew 27:3-10, 19). Some of the additions indicate that he utilized traditions that he had received from elsewhere; others are due to his own theological insight (e.g., Matthew 26:28 \". . . for the forgiveness of sins\"; Matthew 27:52). In his editing Matthew also altered Mark in some minor details. But there is no need to suppose that he knew any passion narrative other than Mark's","2":"[1-2] When Jesus finished all these words: see the note on Matthew 7:28-29. \"You know . . . crucified\": Matthew turns Mark's statement of the time ( Mark 14:1) into Jesus' final prediction of his passion.

No reason is given why the plan was changed","5":"[6-13] See the notes on Mark 14:3-9 and John 12:1-8","6":"[12] To prepare me for burial: cf Mark 14:8. In accordance with the interpretation of this act as Jesus' burial anointing, Matthew, more consistent than Mark, changes the purpose of the visit of the women to Jesus' tomb; they do not go to anoint him ( Mark 16:1) but \"to see the tomb\" ( Matthew 28:1)","7":"[14] Iscariot: see the note on Luke 6:16","8":"[15] The motive of avarice is introduced by Judas's question about the price for betrayal, which is absent in the Marcan source ( Mark 14:10-11). Hand him over: the same Greek verb is used to express the saving purpose of God by which Jesus is handed over to death (cf Matthew 17:22; 20:18; 26:2) and the human malice that hands him over. Thirty pieces of silver: the price of the betrayal is found only in Matthew. It is derived from Zechariah 11:12 where it is the wages paid to the rejected shepherd, a cheap price ( Zechariah 11:13). That amount is also the compensation paid to one whose slave has been gored by an ox ( Exodus 21:32)","9":"[17] The first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread: see the note on Mark 14:1. Matthew omits Mark's \"when they sacrificed the Passover lamb.&quot","10":"[18] By omitting much of Mark 14:13-15, adding My appointed time draws near, and turning the question into a statement, in your house I shall celebrate the Passover, Matthew has given this passage a solemnity and majesty greater than that of his source","11":"[21] Given Matthew's interest in the fulfillment of the Old Testament, it is curious that he omits the Marcan designation of Jesus' betrayer as \"one who is eating with me\" ( Mark 14:18), since that is probably an allusion to Ps 41, 10. However, the shocking fact that the betrayer is one who shares table fellowship with Jesus is emphasized in Matthew 26:23","12":"[24] It would be better . . . born: the enormity of the deed is such that it would be better not to exist than to do it","13":"[25] Peculiar to Matthew. You have said so: cf Matthew 26:64; 27:11. This is a half-affirmative. Emphasis is laid on the pronoun and the answer implies that the statement would not have been made if the question had not been asked","14":"[26] See the note on Mark 14:22-24. The Marcan-Matthean is one of the two major New Testament traditions of the words of Jesus when instituting the Eucharist. The other (and earlier) is the Pauline-Lucan ( 1 Cor 11:23-25; Luke 22:19-20). Each shows the influence of Christian liturgical usage, but the Marcan-Matthean is more developed in that regard than the Pauline-Lucan. The words over the bread and cup succeed each other without the intervening meal mentioned in 1 Cor 11:25; Luke 22:20; and there is parallelism between the consecratory words (this is my body . . . this is my blood). Matthew follows Mark closely but with some changes","15":"[26] See the note on Matthew 14:19. Said the blessing: a prayer blessing God. Take and eat: literally, Take, eat. Eat is an addition to Mark's \"take it\" (literally, \"take\"; Mark 14:22). This is my body: the bread is identified with Jesus himself. Matthew 26:26-2","16":"[27-28] Gave thanks: see the note on Matthew 15:36. Gave it to them . . . all of you: cf Mark 14:23-24. In the Marcan sequence the disciples drink and then Jesus says the interpretative words. Matthew has changed this into a command to drink followed by those words. My blood: see Lev 17:11 for the concept that the blood is \"the seat of life\" and that when placed on the altar it \"makes atonement.\" Which will be shed: the present participle, \"being shed\" or \"going to be shed,\" is future in relation to the Last Supper. On behalf of: Greek peri; see the note on Mark 14:24. Many: see the note on Matthew 20:28. For the forgiveness of sins: a Matthean addition. The same phrase occurs in Mark 1:4 in connection with John's baptism but Matthew avoids it there ( Matthew 3:11). He places it here probably because he wishes to emphasize that it is the sacrificial death of Jesus that brings forgiveness of sins","17":"[29] Although his death will interrupt the table fellowship he has had with the disciples, Jesus confidently predicts his vindication by God and a new table fellowship with them at the banquet of the kingdom","18":"[30] See the note on Mark 14:26","19":"[31] Will have . . . shaken: literally, \"will be scandalized in me\"; see the note on Matthew 24:9-12. I will strike . . . dispersed: cf Zechariah 13:7","20":"[34] Before the cock crows: see the note on Matthew 14:25. The third watch of the night was called \"cockcrow.\" Deny me: see the note on Matthew 16:24","21":"[36-56] Cf Mark 14:32-52. The account of Jesus in Gethsemane is divided between that of his agony ( Matthew 26:36-46) and that of his betrayal and arrest ( Matthew 26:47-56). Jesus' sorrow and distress ( Matthew 26:37) in face of death is unrelieved by the presence of his three disciples who, though urged to watch with him ( Matthew 26:38, 41), fall asleep ( Matthew 26:40, 43). He prays that if . . . possible his death may be avoided ( Matthew 26:39) but that his Father's will be done ( Matthew 26:39, 42, 44). Knowing then that his death must take place, he announces to his companions that the hour for his being handed over has come ( Matthew 26:45). Judas arrives with an armed band provided by the Sanhedrin and greets Jesus with a kiss, the prearranged sign for his identification ( Matthew 26:47-49). After his arrest, he rebukes a disciple who has attacked the high priest's servant with a sword ( Matthew 26:51-54), and chides those who have come out to seize him with swords and clubs as if he were a robber ( Matthew 26:55-56). In both rebukes Jesus declares that the treatment he is how receiving is the fulfillment of the scriptures ( Matthew 26:55, 56). How should be now the subsequent flight of all the disciples is itself the fulfillment of his own prediction (cf 31). In this episode, Matthew follows Mark with a few alterations","22":"[36] Gethsemane: the Hebrew name means \"oil press\" and designates an olive orchard on the western slope of the Mount of Olives; see the note on Matthew 21:1. The name appears only in Matthew and Mark. The place is called a \"garden\" in John 18:1","23":"[37] Peter and the two sons of Zebedee: cf Matthew 17:1","24":"[38] Cf Psalm 42:5, 11. In the Septuagint ( Psalm 41:4, 11) the same Greek word for sorrowful is used as here. To death: i.e., \"enough to die\"; cf Jonah 4:9","25":"[39] My Father: see the note on Mark 14:36. Matthew omits the Aramaic 'abba' and adds the qualifier my. This cup: see the note on Mark 10:38-40","26":"[41] Undergo the test: see the note on Matthew 6:13. In that verse \"the final test\" translates the same Greek word as is here translated the test, and these are the only instances of the use of that word in Matthew. It is possible that the passion of Jesus is seen here as an anticipation of the great tribulation that will precede the parousia (see the notes on Matthew 24:8; 24:21) to which Matthew 6:13 refers, and that just as Jesus prays to be delivered from death ( Matthew 26:39), so he exhorts the disciples to pray that they will not have to undergo the great test that his passion would be for them. Some scholars, however, understand not undergo (literally, \"not enter\") the test as meaning not that the disciples may be spared the test but that they may not yield to the temptation of falling away from Jesus because of his passion even though they will have to endure it","27":"[42] Your will be done: cf Matthew 6:10","28":"[49] Rabbi: see the note on Matthew 23:6-7. Jesus is so addressed twice in Matthew ( Matthew 26:25), both times by Judas. For the significance of the closely related address \"teacher\" in Matthew, see the note on Matthew 8:19","29":"[55] Day after day . . . arrest me: cf Mark 14:49. This suggests that Jesus had taught for a relatively long period in Jerusalem, whereas Matthew 21:1-11 puts his coming to the city for the first time only a few days before","30":"[57-68] Following Mark 14:53-65 Matthew presents the nighttime appearance of Jesus before the Sanhedrin as a real trial. After many false witnesses bring charges against him that do not suffice for the death sentence (Matthew 14:60), two came forward who charge him with claiming to be able to destroy the temple . . . and within three days to rebuild it (Matthew 14:60-61). Jesus makes no answer even when challenged to do so by the high priest, who then orders him to declare under oath . . . whether he is the Messiah, the Son of God ( Matthew 26:62-63). Matthew changes Mark's clear affirmative response ( Mark 14:62) to the same one as that given to Judas ( Matthew 26:25), but follows Mark almost verbatim in Jesus' predicting that his judges will see him (the Son of Man) seated at the right hand of God and coming on the clouds of heaven ( Matthew 26:64). The high priest then charges him with blasphemy ( Matthew 26:65), a charge with which the other members of the Sanhedrin agree by declaring that he deserves to die ( Matthew 26:66). They then attack him ( Matthew 26:67) and mockingly demand that he prophesy ( Matthew 26:68). This account contains elements that are contrary to the judicial procedures prescribed in the Mishnah, the Jewish code of law that dates in written form from ca. A.D. 200, e.g., trial on a feast day, a night session of the court, pronouncement of a verdict of condemnation at the same session at which testimony was received. Consequently, some scholars regard the account entirely as a creation of the early Christians without historical value. However, it is disputable whether the norms found in the Mishnah were in force at the time of Jesus. More to the point is the question whether the Matthean-Marcan night trial derives from a combination of two separate incidents, a nighttime preliminary investigation (cf John 18:13, 19-24) and a formal trial on the following morning (cf Luke 22:66-71)","31":"[57] Caiaphas: see the note on Matthew 26:3","32":"[59] Sanhedrin: see the note on Luke 22:66","33":"[60-61] Two: cf Deut 19:15. I can destroy . . . rebuild it: there are significant differences from the Marcan parallel ( Mark 14:58). Matthew omits \"made with hands\" and \"not made with hands\" and changes Mark's \"will destroy\" and \"will build another\" to can destroy and (can) rebuild. The charge is probably based on Jesus' prediction of the temple's destruction; see the notes on Matthew 23:37-39; 24:2; and John 2:19. A similar prediction by Jeremiah was considered as deserving death; cf Jeremiah 7:1-15; 26:1-8","34":"[63] Silent: possibly an allusion to Isaiah 53:7. I order you . . . living God: peculiar to Matthew; cf Mark 14:61","35":"[64] + You have said so: see the note on Matthew 26:25. From now on . . . heaven: the Son of Man who is to be crucified (cf Matthew 20:19) will be seen in glorious majesty (cf Psalm 110:1) and coming on the clouds of heaven (cf Daniel 7:13). The Power: see the note on Mark 14:61-62","36":"[65] Blasphemed: the punishment for blasphemy was death by stoning (see Lev 24:10-16). According to the Mishnah, to be guilty of blasphemy one had to pronounce \"the Name itself,\" i.e. Yahweh; cf Sanhedrin 7, 4.5. Those who judge the gospel accounts of Jesus' trial by the later Mishnah standards point out that Jesus uses the surrogate \"the Power,\" and hence no Jewish court would have regarded him as guilty of blasphemy; others hold that the Mishnah's narrow understanding of blasphemy was a later development","37":"[67-68] The physical abuse, apparently done to Jesus by the members of the Sanhedrin themselves, recalls the sufferings of the Isaian Servant of the Lord; cf Isaiah 50:6. The mocking challenge to prophesy is probably motivated by Jesus' prediction of his future glory ( Matthew 26:64)","38":"[70] Denied it in front of everyone: see Matthew 10:33.

It depends in part on Mark and Q (cf Mark 12:38-39; Luke 11:37-52; 13:34-35), but in the main it is peculiar to Matthew. (For the reasons against considering this extensive body of sayings-material either as one of the structural discourses of this gospel or as part of the one that follows in Matthew 24-25, see the note on Matthew 19:1- 23:39.) While the tradition of a deep opposition between Jesus and the Pharisees is well founded, this speech reflects an opposition that goes beyond that of Jesus' ministry and must be seen as expressing the bitter conflict between Pharisaic Judaism and the church of Matthew at the time when the gospel was composed. The complaint often made that the speech ignores the positive qualities of Pharisaism and of its better representatives is true, but the complaint overlooks the circumstances that gave rise to the invective. Nor is the speech purely anti-Pharisaic. The evangelist discerns in his church many of the same faults that he finds in its opponents and warns his fellow Christians to look to their own conduct and attitudes.","2":"[2-3] Have taken their seat . . . Moses: it is uncertain whether this is simply a metaphor for Mosaic teaching authority or refers to an actual chair on which the teacher sat. It has been proved that there was a seat so designated in synagogues of a later period than that of this gospel. Do and observe . . . they tell you: since the Matthean Jesus abrogates Mosaic law ( Matthew 5:31-42), warns his disciples against the teaching of the Pharisees ( Matthew 14:1-12), and, in this speech, denounces the Pharisees as blind guides in respect to their teaching on oaths (Matthew 16-22), this commandment to observe all things whatsoever they (the scribes and Pharisees) tell you cannot be taken as the evangelist's understanding of the proper standard of conduct for his church. The saying may reflect a period when the Matthean community was largely Jewish Christian and was still seeking to avoid a complete break with the synagogue. Matthew has incorporated this traditional material into the speech in accordance with his view of the course of salvation history, in which he portrays the time of Jesus' ministry as marked by the fidelity to the law, although with significant pointers to the new situation that would exist after his death and resurrection (see the note on Matthew 5:17-20). The crowds and the disciples ( Matthew 23:1) are exhorted not to follow the example of the Jewish leaders, whose deeds do not conform to their teaching ( Matthew 23:3)","3":"[4] Tie up heavy burdens: see the note on Matthew 11:28","4":"[5] To the charge of preaching but not practicing ( Matthew 23:3), Jesus adds that of acting in order to earn praise. The disciples have already been warned against this same fault (see the note on Matthew 6:1-18). Phylacteries: the Mosaic law required that during prayer small boxes containing parchments on which verses of scripture were written be worn on the left forearm and the forehead (see Exodus 13:9, 16; Deut 6:8; 11:18). Tassels: see the note on Matthew 9:20. The widening of phylacteries and the lengthening of tassels were for the purpose of making these evidences of piety more noticeable","5":"[6] Cf Mark 12:38-39. \"Rabbi': literally, \"my great one,\" a title of respect for teachers and leaders","6":"[8-12] These verses, warning against the use of various titles, are addressed to the disciples alone. While only the title \"Rabbi' has been said to be used in addressing the scribes and Pharisees ( Matthew 23:7), the implication is that Father and \"Master' also were. The prohibition of these titles to the disciples suggests that their use was present in Matthew's church. The Matthean Jesus forbids not only the titles but the spirit of superiority and pride that is shown by their acceptance. Whoever exalts . . . will be exalted: cf Luke 14:11","7":"[13-36] This series of seven \"woes,\" directed against the scribes and Pharisees and addressed to them, is the heart of the speech. The phrase woe to occurs often in the prophetic and apocalyptic literature, expressing horror of a sin and punishment for those who commit it. Hypocrites: see the note on Matthew 6:2. The hypocrisy of the scribes and Pharisees consists in the difference between their speech and action Matthew 23:3 and in demonstrations of piety that have no other purpose than to enhance their reputation as religious persons ( Matthew 23:5)","8":"[13] You lock the kingdom of heaven: cf Matthew 16:19 where Jesus tells Peter that he will give him the keys to the kingdom of heaven. The purpose of the authority expressed by that metaphor is to give entrance into the kingdom (the kingdom is closed only to those who reject the authority); here the charge is made that the authority of the scribes and Pharisees is exercised in such a way as to be an obstacle to entrance. Cf Luke 11:52 where the accusation against the \"scholars of the law\" (Matthew's scribes) is that they \"have taken away the key of knowledge.&quot","9":"[14] Some manuscripts add a verse here or after Matthew 23:12 \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites. You devour the houses of widows and, as a pretext, recite lengthy prayers. Because of this, you will receive a very severe condemnation.\" Cf Mark 12:40; Luke 20:47. This \"woe\" is almost identical with Mark 12:40 and seems to be an interpolation derived from that text","10":"[15] In the first century A.D. until the First Jewish Revolt against Rome (A.D. 66-70), many Pharisees conducted a vigorous missionary campaign among Gentiles. Convert: literally, \"proselyte,\" a Gentile who accepted Judaism fully by submitting to circumcision and all other requirements of Mosaic law. Child of Gehenna: worthy of everlasting punishment; for Gehenna, see the note on Matthew 5:22. Twice as much as yourselves: possibly this refers simply to the zeal of the convert, surpassing that of the one who converted him","11":"[16-22] An attack on the casuistry that declared some oaths binding (one is obligated) and others not (it means nothing) and held the binding oath to be the one made by something of lesser value (the gold; the gift on the altar). Such teaching, which inverts the order of values, reveals the teachers to be blind guides; cf Matthew 15:14. Since the Matthean Jesus forbids all oaths to his disciples ( Matthew 5:33-37), this woe does not set up a standard for Christian moral conduct, but ridicules the Pharisees on their own terms","12":"[23] The Mosaic law ordered tithing of the produce of the land ( Lev 27:30; Deut 14:22-23), and the scribal tradition is said here to have extended this law to even the smallest herbs. The practice is criticized not in itself but because it shows the Pharisees' preoccupation with matters of less importance while they neglect the weightier things of the law","13":"[24] Cf Lev 11:41-45 that forbids the eating of any \"swarming creature.\" The Pharisees' scrupulosity about minor matters and neglect of greater ones ( Matthew 23:23) is further brought out by this contrast between straining liquids that might contain a tiny \"swarming creature\" and yet swallowing the camel. The latter was one of the unclean animals forbidden by the law ( Lev 11:4), but it is hardly possible that the scribes and Pharisees are being denounced as guilty of so gross a violation of the food laws. To swallow the camel is only a hyperbolic way of speaking of their neglect of what is important","14":"[25-26] The ritual washing of utensils for dining (cf Mark 7:4) is turned into a metaphor illustrating a concern for appearances while inner purity is ignored. The scribes and Pharisees are compared to cups carefully washed on the outside but filthy within. Self-indulgence: the Greek word here translated means lack of self-control, whether in drinking or in sexual conduct","15":"[27-28] The sixth woe, like the preceding one, deals with concern for externals and neglect of what is inside. Since contact with dead bodies, even when one was unaware of it, caused ritual impurity ( Numbers 19:11-22), tombs were whitewashed so that no one would contract such impurity inadvertently","16":"[29-36] The final woe is the most serious indictment of all. It portrays the scribes and Pharisees as standing in the same line as their ancestors who murdered the prophets and the righteous","17":"[29-32] In spite of honoring the slain dead by building their tombs and adorning their memorials, and claiming that they would not have joined in their ancestors' crimes if they had lived in their days, the scribes and Pharisees are true children of their ancestors and are defiantly ordered by Jesus to fill up what those ancestors measured out. This order reflects the Jewish notion that there was an allotted measure of suffering that had to be completed before God's final judgment would take place","18":"[34-36] There are important differences between the Matthean and the Lucan form of this Q material; cf Luke 11:49-51. In Luke the one who sends the emissaries is the \"wisdom of God.\" If, as many scholars think, that is the original wording of Q, Matthew, by making Jesus the sender, has presented him as the personified divine wisdom. In Luke, wisdom's emissaries are the Old Testament \"prophets\" and the Christian \"apostles.\" Matthew's prophets and wise men and scribes are probably Christian disciples alone; cf Matthew 10:41 and see the note on Matthew 13:52. You will kill: see Matthew 24:9. Scourge in your synagogues . . . town to town: see Matthew 10:17, 23 and the note on Matthew 10:17. All the righteous blood shed upon the earth: the slaying of the disciples is in continuity with all the shedding of righteous blood beginning with that of Abel. The persecution of Jesus' disciples by this generation involves the persecutors in the guilt of their murderous ancestors. The blood of Zechariah: see the note on Luke 11:51. By identifying him as the son of Barachiah Matthew understands him to be Zechariah the Old Testament minor prophet; see Zechariah 1:1","19":"[37-39] Cf Luke 13:34-35. The denunciation of Pharisaic Judaism ends with this lament over Jerusalem, which has repeatedly rejected and murdered those whom God has sent to her. How many times: this may refer to various visits of Jesus to the city, an aspect of his ministry found in John but otherwise not in the synoptics. As a hen . . . under her wings: for imagery similar to this, see Psalm 17:8; 91:4. Your house . . . desolate: probably an allusion to the destruction of the temple in A.D. 70. You will not see me . . . in the name of the Lord: Israel will not see Jesus again until he comes in glory for the final judgment. The acclamation has been interpreted in contrasting ways, as an indication that Israel will at last accept Jesus at that time, and as its troubled recognition of him as its dreaded judge who will pronounce its condemnation; in support of the latter view see Matthew 24:30"}},"5":{"verses":{"1":{"verse":"When he saw the crowds, he went up the mountain, and after he had sat down, his disciples came to him.","annotations":["1","2"]},"2":{"verse":"He began to teach them, saying:","annotations":[]},"3":{"verse":"\"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.","annotations":["3","4"]},"4":{"verse":"Blessed are they who mourn, for they will be comforted.","annotations":["5"]},"5":{"verse":"Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the land.","annotations":["6"]},"6":{"verse":"Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied.","annotations":["7"]},"7":{"verse":"Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.","annotations":[]},"8":{"verse":"Blessed are the clean of heart, for they will see God.","annotations":["8"]},"9":{"verse":"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.","annotations":[]},"10":{"verse":"Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.","annotations":["9"]},"11":{"verse":"Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you and utter every kind of evil against you (falsely) because of me.","annotations":[]},"12":{"verse":"Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven.

It is the discourse section of the first book and contains sayings of Jesus derived from Q and from M. The Lucan parallel is in that gospel's \"Sermon on the Plain\" ( Luke 6:20-49), although some of the sayings in Matthew's \"Sermon on the Mount\" have their parallels in other parts of Luke. The careful topical arrangement of the sermon is probably not due only to Matthew's editing; he seems to have had a structured discourse of Jesus as one of his sources. The form of that source may have been as follows: four beatitudes ( Matthew 5:3-4, 6, 11-12), a section on the new righteousness with illustrations ( Matthew 5:17, 20-24, 27-28, 33-48), a section on good works ( Matthew 6:1-6, 16-18), and three warnings ( Matthew 7:1-2, 15-21, 24-27)","2":"[1-2] Unlike Luke's sermon, this is addressed not only to the disciples but to the crowds (see Matthew 7:28).","3":"[3-12] The form Blessed are (is) occurs frequently in the Old Testament in the Wisdom literature and in the psalms. Although modified by Matthew, the first, second, fourth, and ninth beatitudes have Lucan parallels ( Matthew 5:3; Luke 6:20; Matthew 5:4; Luke 6:21, 22; Matthew 5:6; Luke 6:21a; Matthew 5:11-12; Luke 5:22-23). The others were added by the evangelist and are probably his own composition. A few manuscripts, Western and Alexandrian, and many versions and patristic quotations give the second and third beatitudes in inverted order","4":"[3] The poor in spirit: in the Old Testament, the poor (anawim) are those who are without material possessions and whose confidence is in God (see Isaiah 61:1; Zephaniah 2:3; in the NAB the word is translated lowly and humble, respectively, in those texts). Matthew added in spirit in order either to indicate that only the devout poor were meant or to extend the beatitude to all, of whatever social rank, who recognized their complete dependence on God. The same phrase poor in spirit is found in the Qumran literature (1QM 14:7)","5":"[4] Cf Isaiah 61:2 \"(The Lord has sent me) . . . to comfort all who mourn.\" They will be comforted: here the passive is a \"theological passive\" equivalent to the active \"God will comfort them\"; so also in Matthew 5:6, 7","6":"[5] Cf Psalm 37:11,\". . . the meek shall possess the land.\" In the psalm \"the land\" means the land of Palestine; here it means the kingdom","7":"[6] For righteousness: a Matthean addition. For the meaning of righteousness here, see the note on Matthew 3:14-15","8":"[8] Cf Psalm 24:4. Only one \"whose heart is clean\" can take part in the temple worship. To be with God in the temple is described in Psalm 42:2 as \"beholding his face,\" but here the promise to the clean of heart is that they will see God not in the temple but in the coming kingdom","9":"[10] Righteousness here, as usually in Matthew, means conduct in conformity with God's will","10":"[12] The prophets who were before you: the disciples of Jesus stand in the line of the persecuted prophets of Israel. Some would see the expression as indicating also that Matthew considered all Christian disciples as prophets","11":"[13-16] By their deeds the disciples are to influence the world for good. They can no more escape notice than a city set on a mountain. If they fail in good works, they are as useless as flavorless salt or as a lamp whose light is concealed","12":"[13] The unusual supposition of salt losing its flavor has led some to suppose that the saying refers to the salt of the Dead Sea that, because chemically impure, could lose its taste","13":"[17-20] This statement of Jesus' position concerning the Mosaic law is composed of traditional material from Matthew's sermon documentation (see the note on Matthew 5:1- 7:29), other Q material (cf Matthew 18; Luke 16:17), and the evangelist's own editorial touches. To fulfill the law appears at first to mean a literal enforcement of the law in the least detail: until heaven and earth pass away nothing of the law will pass ( Matthew 5:18). Yet the \"passing away\" of heaven and earth is not necessarily the end of the world understood, as in much apocalyptic literature, as the dissolution of the existing universe. The \"turning of the ages\" comes with the apocalyptic event of Jesus' death and resurrection, and those to whom this gospel is addressed are living in the new and final age, prophesied by Isaiah as the time of \"new heavens and a new earth\" ( Isaiah 65:17; 66:22). Meanwhile, during Jesus' ministry when the kingdom is already breaking in, his mission remains within the framework of the law, though with significant anticipation of the age to come, as the following antitheses ( Matthew 5:21-48) show","14":"[19] Probably these commandments means those of the Mosaic law. But this is an interim ethic \"until heaven and earth pass away.&quot","15":"[21-48] Six examples of the conduct demanded of the Christian disciple. Each deals with a commandment of the law, introduced by You have heard that it was said to your ancestors or an equivalent formula, followed by Jesus' teaching in respect to that commandment, But I say to you; thus their designation as \"antitheses.\" Three of them accept the Mosaic law but extend or deepen it ( Matthew 5:21-22; 27-28; 43-44); three reject it as a standard of conduct for the disciples (Matthew 31-32; 33-37; 38-39)","16":"[21] Cf Exodus 20:13; Deut 5:17. The second part of the verse is not an exact quotation from the Old Testament, but cf Exodus 21:12","17":"[22-26] Reconciliation with an offended brother is urged in the admonition of Matthew 5:23-24 and the parable of Matthew 5:25-26 ( Luke 12:58-59). The severity of the judge in the parable is a warning of the fate of unrepentant sinners in the coming judgment by God","18":"[22] Anger is the motive behind murder, as the insulting epithets are steps that may lead to it. They, as well as the deed, are all forbidden. Raqa: an Aramaic word reqa' or reqa probably meaning \"imbecile,\" \"blockhead,\" a term of abuse. The ascending order of punishment, judgment (by a local council?), trial before the Sanhedrin, condemnation to Gehenna, points to a higher degree of seriousness in each of the offenses. Sanhedrin: the highest judicial body of Judaism. Gehenna: in Hebrew ge-hinnom, \"Valley of Hinnom,\" or ge Ben-hinnom, \"Valley of the son of Hinnom,\" southwest of Jerusalem, the center of an idolatrous cult during the monarchy in which children were offered in sacrifice (see 2 Kings 23:10; Jeremiah 7:31). In Joshua 18:16 (Septuagint, Codex Vaticanus) the Hebrew is transliterated into Greek as gaienna, which appears in the New Testament as geenna. The concept of punishment of sinners by fire either after death or after the final judgment is found in Jewish apocalyptic literature (e.g., Enoch 90:26) but the name geenna is first given to the place of punishment in the New Testament","19":"[27] See Exodus 20:14; Deut 5:18","20":"[29-30] No sacrifice is too great to avoid total destruction in Gehenna","21":"[31-32] See Deut 24:1-5. The Old Testament commandment that a bill of divorce be given to the woman assumes the legitimacy of divorce itself. It is this that Jesus denies. (Unless the marriage is unlawful): this \"exceptive clause,\" as it is often called, occurs also in Matthew 19:9, where the Greek is slightly different. There are other sayings of Jesus about divorce that prohibit it absolutely (see Mark 10:11-12; Luke 16:18; cf 1 Cor 7:10, 11b), and most scholars agree that they represent the stand of Jesus. Matthew's \"exceptive clauses\" are understood by some as a modification of the absolute prohibition. It seems, however, that the unlawfulness that Matthew gives as a reason why a marriage must be broken refers to a situation peculiar to his community: the violation of Mosaic law forbidding marriage between persons of certain blood and/or legal relationship ( Lev 18:6-18). Marriages of that sort were regarded as incest (porneia), but some rabbis allowed Gentile converts to Judaism who had contracted such marriages to remain in them. Matthew's \"exceptive clause\" is against such permissiveness for Gentile converts to Christianity; cf the similar prohibition of porneia in Acts 15:20, 29. In this interpretation, the clause constitutes no exception to the absolute prohibition of divorce when the marriage is lawful","22":"[33] This is not an exact quotation of any Old Testament text, but see Exodus 20:7; Deut 5:11; Lev 19:12. The purpose of an oath was to guarantee truthfulness by one's calling on God as witness","23":"[34-36] The use of these oath formularies that avoid the divine name is in fact equivalent to swearing by it, for all the things sworn by are related to God","24":"[37] Let your `Yes' mean `Yes,' and your `No' mean `No': literally, \"let your speech be 'Yes, yes,' 'No, no.' \" Some have understood this as a milder form of oath, permitted by Jesus. In view of Matthew 5:34, \"Do not swear at all,\" that is unlikely. From the evil one: i.e., from the devil. Oath-taking presupposes a sinful weakness of the human race, namely, the tendency to lie. Jesus demands of his disciples a truthfulness that makes oaths unnecessary","25":"[38-42] See Lev 24:20. The Old Testament commandment was meant to moderate vengeance; the punishment should not exceed the injury done. Jesus forbids even this proportionate retaliation. Of the five examples that follow, only the first deals directly with retaliation for evil; the others speak of liberality","26":"[41] Roman garrisons in Palestine had the right to requisition the property and services of the native population","27":"[43-48] See Lev 19:18. There is no Old Testament commandment demanding hatred of one's enemy, but the \"neighbor\" of the love commandment was understood as one's fellow countryman. Both in the Old Testament ( Psalm 139:19-22) and at Qumran (1QS 9:21) hatred of evil persons is assumed to be right. Jesus extends the love commandment to the enemy and the persecutor. His disciples, as children of God, must imitate the example of their Father, who grants his gifts of sun and rain to both the good and the bad","28":"[46] Tax collectors: Jews who were engaged in the collection of indirect taxes such as tolls and customs. See the note on Mark 2:14","29":"[47] Jesus' disciples must not be content with merely usual standards of conduct; see Matthew 5:20 where the verb \"surpass\" (Greek perisseuo) is cognate with the unusual (perisson) of this verse","30":"[48] Perfect: in the gospels this word occurs only in Matthew, here and in Matthew 19:21.

The Marcan source ( Matthew 6:14-29) is much reduced and in some points changed. In Mark Herod reveres John as a holy man and the desire to kill him is attributed to Herodias ( Matthew 6:19, 20), whereas here that desire is Herod's from the beginning ( Matthew 6:5)","2":"[1] Herod the tetrarch: Herod Antipas, son of Herod the Great. When the latter died, his territory was divided among three of his surviving sons, Archelaus who received half of it ( Matthew 2:23), Herod Antipas who became ruler of Galilee and Perea, and Philip who became ruler of northern Transjordan. Since he received a quarter of his father's domain, Antipas is accurately designated tetrarch (\"ruler of a fourth [part]\"), although in Matthew 14:9 Matthew repeats the \"king\" of his Marcan source ( Matthew 6:26).","3":"[3] Herodias was not the wife of Herod's half-brother Philip but of another half-brother, Herod Boethus. The union was prohibited by Lev 18:16; 20:21.

The principal reason for that may be that it was seen as anticipating the Eucharist and the final banquet in the kingdom ( Matthew 8:11; 26:29), but it looks not only forward but backward, to the feeding of Israel with manna in the desert at the time of the Exodus (Exodus 16), a miracle that in some contemporary Jewish expectation would be repeated in the messianic age (2 Baruch 29:8). It may also be meant to recall Elisha's feeding a hundred men with small provisions ( 2 Kings 4:42-44)","5":"[19] The taking, saying the blessing, breaking, and giving to the disciples correspond to the actions of Jesus over the bread at the Last Supper ( Matthew 26:26). Since they were usual at any Jewish meal, that correspondence does not necessarily indicate a eucharistic reference here. Matthew's silence about Jesus' dividing the fish among the people ( Mark 6:41) is perhaps more significant in that regard","6":"[20] The fragments left over: as in Elisha's miracle, food was left over after all had been fed.

The beatitude is a warning to the Baptist not to disbelieve because his expectations have not been met","6":"[7-19] Jesus' rebuke of John is counterbalanced by a reminder of the greatness of the Baptist's function ( Matthew 11:7-15) that is followed by a complaint about those who have heeded neither John nor Jesus ( Matthew 11:16-19)","7":"[9-10] In common Jewish belief there had been no prophecy in Israel since the last of the Old Testament prophets, Malachi. The coming of a new prophet was eagerly awaited, and Jesus agrees that John was such. Yet he was more than a prophet, for he was the precursor of the one who would bring in the new and final age. The Old Testament quotation is a combination of Malachi 3:1; Exodus 23:20 with the significant change that the before me of Malachi becomes before you.

The first represents John, Jesus, and their disciples; the second those who reject John for his asceticism and Jesus for his table association with those despised by the religiously observant. Matthew 11:19c (her works) forms an inclusion with Matthew 11:2 (\"the works of the Messiah\"). The original form of the saying is better preserved in Luke 7:35 \". . . wisdom is vindicated by all her children.\" There John and Jesus are the children of Wisdom; here the works of Jesus the Messiah are those of divine Wisdom, of which he is the embodiment.

Acceptance depends upon the Father's revelation, but this is granted to those who are open to receive it and refused to the arrogant.

Matthew's account of the Roman trial before Pilate is introduced by a consultation of the Sanhedrin after which Jesus is handed over to . . . the governor ( Matthew 27:1-2). Matthew follows his Marcan source closely but adds some material that is peculiar to him, the death of Judas ( Matthew 27:3-10), possibly the name Jesus as the name of Barabbas also ( Matthew 27:16-17), the intervention of Pilate's wife ( Matthew 27:19), Pilate's washing his hands in token of his disclaiming responsibility for Jesus' death ( Matthew 27:24), and the assuming of that responsibility by the whole people ( Matthew 27:25)","2":"[1] There is scholarly disagreement about the meaning of the Sanhedrin's taking counsel (symboulion elabon; cf Matthew 12:14; 22:15; 27:7; 28:12); see the note on Mark 15:1. Some understand it as a discussion about the strategy for putting their death sentence against Jesus into effect since they lacked the right to do so themselves. Others see it as the occasion for their passing that sentence, holding that Matthew, unlike Mark ( Mark 14:64), does not consider that it had been passed in the night session ( Matthew 26:66). Even in the latter interpretation, their handing him over to Pilate is best explained on the hypothesis that they did not have competence to put their sentence into effect, as is stated in John 18:31.","3":"[3] The thirty pieces of silver: see Matthew 26:15","4":"[5-8] For another tradition about the death of Judas, cf Acts 1:18-19. The two traditions agree only in the purchase of a field with the money paid to Judas for his betrayal of Jesus and the name given to the field, the Field of Blood. In Acts Judas himself buys the field and its name comes from his own blood shed in his fatal accident on it. The potter's field: this designation of the field is based on the fulfillment citation in Matthew 27:10","5":"[9-10] Cf Matthew 26:15. Matthew's attributing this text to Jeremiah is puzzling, for there is no such text in that book, and the thirty pieces of silver thrown by Judas \"into the temple\" ( Matthew 27:5) recall rather Zechariah 11:12-13. It is usually said that the attribution of the text to Jeremiah is due to Matthew's combining the Zechariah text with texts from Jeremiah that speak of a potter ( Jeremiah 18:2-3), the buying of a field ( Jeremiah 32:6-9), or the breaking of a potter's flask at Topheth in the valley of Ben-hinnom with the prediction that it will become a burial place ( Jeremiah 19:1-13)","6":"[11] King of the Jews: this title is used of Jesus only by pagans. The Matthean instances are, besides this verse, Matthew 2:2; 27:29, 37. Matthew equates it with \"Messiah\"; cf Matthew 2:2, 4 and Matthew 27:17, 22 where he has changed \"the king of the Jews\" of his Marcan source ( Mark 15:9, 12) to \"(Jesus) called Messiah.\" The normal political connotation of both titles would be of concern to the Roman governor. You say so: see the note on Matthew 26:25. An unqualified affirmative response is not made because Jesus' kingship is not what Pilate would understand it to be","7":"[12-14] Cf Matthew 26:62-63. As in the trial before the Sanhedrin, Jesus' silence may be meant to recall Isaiah 53:7. Greatly amazed: possibly an allusion to Isaiah 52:14-15","8":"[15-26] The choice that Pilate offers the crowd between Barabbas and Jesus is said to be in accordance with a custom of releasing at the Passover feast one prisoner chosen by the crowd ( Matthew 27:15). This custom is mentioned also in Mark 15:6 and John 18:39 but not in Luke; see the note on Luke 23:17. Outside of the gospels there is no direct attestation of it, and scholars are divided in their judgment of the historical reliability of the claim that there was such a practice","9":"[16-17] [Jesus] Barabbas: it is possible that the double name is the original reading; Jesus was a common Jewish name; see the note on Matthew 1:21. This reading is found in only a few textual witnesses, although its absence in the majority can be explained as an omission of Jesus made for reverential reasons. That name is bracketed because of its uncertain textual attestation. The Aramaic name Barabbas means \"son of the father\"; the irony of the choice offered between him and Jesus, the true son of the Father, would be evident to those addressees of Matthew who knew that","10":"[18] Cf Mark 14:10. This is an example of the tendency, found in varying degree in all the gospels, to present Pilate in a relatively favorable light and emphasize the hostility of the Jewish authorities and eventually of the people","11":"[19] Jesus' innocence is declared by a Gentile woman. In a dream: in Matthew's infancy narrative, dreams are the means of divine communication; cf Matthew 1:20; 2:12, 13, 19, 22","12":"[22] Let him be crucified: incited by the chief priests and elders ( Matthew 27:20), the crowds demand that Jesus be executed by crucifixion, a peculiarly horrible form of Roman capital punishment. The Marcan parallel, \"Crucify him\" ( Mark 15:3), addressed to Pilate, is changed by Matthew to the passive, probably to emphasize the responsibility of the crowds","13":"[24-25] Peculiar to Matthew. Took water . . . blood: cf Deut 21:1-8, the handwashing prescribed in the case of a murder when the killer is unknown. The elders of the city nearest to where the corpse is found must wash their hands, declaring, \"Our hands did not shed this blood.\" Look to it yourselves: cf Matthew 27:4. The whole people: Matthew sees in those who speak these words the entire people (Greek laos) of Israel. His blood . . . and upon our children: cf Jeremiah 26:15. The responsibility for Jesus' death is accepted by the nation that was God's special possession ( Exodus 19:5), his own people (Hosea 2:23), and they thereby lose that high privilege; see Matthew 21:43 and the note on that verse. The controversy between Matthew's church and Pharisaic Judaism about which was the true people of God is reflected here. As the Second Vatican Council has pointed out, guilt for Jesus' death is not attributable to all the Jews of his time or to any Jews of later times","14":"[26] He had Jesus scourged: the usual preliminary to crucifixion","15":"[27] The praetorium: the residence of the Roman governor. His usual place of residence was at Caesarea Maritima on the Mediterranean coast, but he went to Jerusalem during the great feasts, when the influx of pilgrims posed the danger of a nationalistic riot. It is disputed whether the praetorium in Jerusalem was the old palace of Herod in the west of the city or the fortress of Antonia northwest of the temple area. The whole cohort: normally six hundred soldiers","16":"[28] Scarlet military cloak: so Matthew as against the royal purple of Mark 15:17 and John 19:2","17":"[29] Crown out of thorns: probably of long thorns that stood upright so that it resembled the \"radiant\" crown, a diadem with spikes worn by Hellenistic kings. The soldiers' purpose was mockery, not torture. A reed: peculiar to Matthew; a mock scepter","18":"[30] Spat upon him: cf Matthew 26:67 where there also is a possible allusion to Isaiah 50:6","19":"[32] See the note on Mark 15:21. Cyrenian named Simon: Cyrenaica was a Roman province on the north coast of Africa and Cyrene was its capital city. The city had a large population of Greek-speaking Jews. Simon may have been living in Palestine or have come there for the Passover as a pilgrim. Pressed into service: see the note on Matthew 5:41","20":"[34] Wine . . . mixed with gall: cf Mark 15:23 where the drink is \"wine drugged with myrrh,\" a narcotic. Matthew's text is probably an inexact allusion to Psalm 69:22. That psalm belongs to the class called the individual lament, in which a persecuted just man prays for deliverance in the midst of great suffering and also expresses confidence that his prayer will be heard. That theme of the suffering Just One is frequently applied to the sufferings of Jesus in the passion narratives","21":"[35] The clothing of an executed criminal went to his executioner(s), but the description of that procedure in the case of Jesus, found in all the gospels, is plainly inspired by Psalm 22:18. However, that psalm verse is quoted only in John 19:24","22":"[37] The offense of a person condemned to death by crucifixion was written on a tablet that was displayed on his cross. The charge against Jesus was that he had claimed to be the King of the Jews (cf Matthew 27:11), i.e., the Messiah (cf Matthew 27:17, 22)","23":"[38] Revolutionaries: see the note on John 18:40 where the same Greek word as that found here is used for Barabbas","24":"[39-40] Reviled him . . . heads: cf Psalm 22:8. You who would destroy . . . three days; cf Matthew 26:61. If you are the Son of God: the same words as those of the devil in the temptation of Jesus; cf Matthew 4:3, 6","25":"[42] King of Israel: in their mocking of Jesus the members of the Sanhedrin call themselves and their people not \"the Jews\" but Israel","26":"[43] Peculiar to Matthew. He trusted in God . . . wants him: cf Psalm 22:9. He said . . . of God: probably an allusion to Wisdom 2:12-20 where the theme of the suffering Just One appears","27":"[45] Cf Amos 8:9 where on the day of the Lord \"the sun will set at midday.&quot","28":"[46] Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?: Jesus cries out in the words of Psalm 22:2, a psalm of lament that is the Old Testament passage most frequently drawn upon in this narrative. In Mark the verse is cited entirely in Aramaic, which Matthew partially retains but changes the invocation of God to the Hebrew Eli, possibly because that is more easily related to the statement of the following verse about Jesus' calling for Elijah","29":"[47] Elijah: see the note on Matthew 3:4. This prophet, taken up into heaven ( 2 Kings 2:11), was believed to come to the help of those in distress, but the evidences of that belief are all later than the gospels","30":"[50] Gave up his spirit: cf the Marcan parallel ( Mark 15:37), \"breathed his last.\" Matthew's alteration expresses both Jesus' control over his destiny and his obedient giving up of his life to God","31":"[51-53] Veil of the sanctuary . . . bottom: cf Mark 15:38; Luke 23:45. Luke puts this event immediately before the death of Jesus. There were two veils in the Mosaic tabernacle on the model of which the temple was constructed, the outer one before the entrance of the Holy Place and the inner one before the Holy of Holies (see Exodus 26:31-36). Only the high priest could pass through the latter and that only on the Day of Atonement (see Lev 16:1-18). Probably the torn veil of the gospels is the inner one. The meaning of the scene may be that now, because of Jesus' death, all people have access to the presence of God, or that the temple, its holiest part standing exposed, is now profaned and will soon be destroyed. The earth quaked . . . appeared to many: peculiar to Matthew. The earthquake, the splitting of the rocks, and especially the resurrection of the dead saints indicate the coming of the final age. In the Old Testament the coming of God is frequently portrayed with the imagery of an earthquake (see Psalm 68:9; 77:19), and Jesus speaks of the earthquakes that will accompany the \"labor pains\" that signify the beginning of the dissolution of the old world ( Matthew 24:7-8). For the expectation of the resurrection of the dead at the coming of the new and final age, see Daniel 12:1-3. Matthew knows that the end of the old age has not yet come ( Matthew 28:20), but the new age has broken in with the death (and resurrection; cf the earthquake in Matthew 28:2) of Jesus; see the note on Matthew 16:28. After his resurrection: this qualification seems to be due to Matthew's wish to assert the primacy of Jesus' resurrection even though he has placed the resurrection of the dead saints immediately after Jesus' death","32":"[54] Cf Mark 15:39. The Christian confession of faith is made by Gentiles, not only the centurion, as in Mark, but the other soldiers who were keeping watch over Jesus (cf Matthew 27:36)","33":"[55-56] Looking on from a distance: cf Psalm 38:12. Mary Magdalene . . . Joseph: these two women are mentioned again in Matthew 27:61 and Matthew 28:1 and are important as witnesses of the reality of the empty tomb. A James and Joseph are referred to in Matthew 13:55 as brothers of Jesus","34":"[57-61] Cf Mark 15:42-47. Matthew drops Mark's designation of Joseph of Arimathea as \"a distinguished member of the council\" (the Sanhedrin), and makes him a rich man and a disciple of Jesus. The former may be an allusion to Isaiah 53:9 (the Hebrew reading of that text is disputed and the one followed in the NAB OT has nothing about the rich, but they are mentioned in the LXX version). That the tomb was the new tomb of a rich man and that it was seen by the women are indications of an apologetic intent of Matthew; there could be no question about the identity of Jesus' burial place. The other Mary: the mother of James and Joseph (56)","35":"[62-66] Peculiar to Matthew. The story prepares for Matthew 28:11-15 and the Jewish charge that the tomb was empty because the disciples had stolen the body of Jesus ( Matthew 28:13, 15)","36":"[62] The next day . . . preparation: the sabbath. According to the synoptic chronology, in that year the day of preparation (for the sabbath) was the Passover; cf Mark 15:42. The Pharisees: the principal opponents of Jesus during his ministry and, in Matthew's time, of the Christian church, join with the chief priests to guarantee against a possible attempt of Jesus' disciples to steal his body","37":"[64] This last imposture . . . the first: the claim that Jesus has been raised from the dead is clearly the last imposture; the first may be either his claim that he would be raised up (63) or his claim that he was the one with whose ministry the kingdom of God had come (see Matthew 12:28)","38":"[65] The guard is yours: literally, \"have a guard\" or \"you have a guard.\" Either the imperative or the indicative could mean that Pilate granted the petitioners some Roman soldiers as guards, which is the sense of the present translation.

It resembles Luke 12:54-56 and may have been inserted from there. It rebukes the Pharisees and Sadducees who are able to read indications of coming weather but not the indications of the coming kingdom in the signs that Jesus does offer, his mighty deeds and teaching","3":"[4] See the notes on Matthew 12:39, 40","4":"[5-12] Jesus' warning his disciples against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees comes immediately before his promise to confer on Peter the authority to bind and to loose on earth ( Matthew 16:19), an authority that will be confirmed in heaven. Such authority most probably has to do, at least in part, with teaching. The rejection of the teaching authority of the Pharisees (see also Matthew 12:12-14) prepares for a new one derived from Jesus","5":"[6] Leaven: see the note on Matthew 13:33. Sadducees: Matthew's Marcan source speaks rather of \"the leaven of Herod\" ( Matthew 8:15)","6":"[7-11] The disciples, men of little faith, misunderstand Jesus' metaphorical use of leaven, forgetting that, as the feeding of the crowds shows, he is not at a loss to provide them with bread","7":"[12] After his rebuke, the disciples understand that by leaven he meant the corrupting influence of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. The evangelist probably understands this teaching as common to both groups. Since at the time of Jesus' ministry the two differed widely on points of teaching, e.g., the resurrection of the dead, and at the time of the evangelist the Sadducee party was no longer a force in Judaism, the supposed common teaching fits neither period. The disciples' eventual understanding of Jesus' warning contrasts with their continuing obtuseness in the Marcan parallel ( Matthew 8:14-21)","8":"[13-20] The Marcan confession of Jesus as Messiah, made by Peter as spokesman for the other disciples ( Mark 8:27-29; cf also Luke 9:18-20), is modified significantly here. The confession is of Jesus both as Messiah and as Son of the living God ( Matthew 16:16). Jesus' response, drawn principally from material peculiar to Matthew, attributes the confession to a divine revelation granted to Peter alone ( Matthew 16:17) and makes him the rock on which Jesus will build his church ( Matthew 16:18) and the disciple whose authority in the church on earth will be confirmed in heaven, i.e., by God ( Matthew 16:19)","9":"[13] Caesarea Philippi: situated about twenty miles north of the Sea of Galilee in the territory ruled by Philip, a son of Herod the Great, tetrarch from 4 B.C. until his death in A.D. 34 (see the note on Matthew 14:1). He rebuilt the town of Paneas, naming it Caesarea in honor of the emperor, and Philippi (\"of Philip\") to distinguish it from the seaport in Samaria that was also called Caesarea. Who do people say that the Son of Man is?: although the question differs from the Marcan parallel ( Mark 8:27: \"Who . . . that I am?\"), the meaning is the same, for Jesus here refers to himself as the Son of Man (cf Matthew 16:15)","10":"[14] John the Baptist: see Matthew 14:2. Elijah: cf Malachi 3:23-24; Sirach 48:10; and see the note on Matthew 3:4. Jeremiah: an addition of Matthew to the Marcan source","11":"[16] The Son of the living God: see Matthew 2:15; 3:17. The addition of this exalted title to the Marcan confession eliminates whatever ambiguity was attached to the title Messiah. This, among other things, supports the view proposed by many scholars that Matthew has here combined his source's confession with a post-resurrectional confession of faith in Jesus as Son of the living God that belonged to the appearance of the risen Jesus to Peter; cf 1 Cor 15:5; Luke 24:34","12":"[17] Flesh and blood: a Semitic expression for human beings, especially in their weakness. Has not revealed this . . . but my heavenly Father: that Peter's faith is spoken of as coming not through human means but through a revelation from God is similar to Paul's description of his recognition of who Jesus was; see Gal 1:15-16, \". . . when he [God] . . . was pleased to reveal his Son to me. . . .&quot","13":"[18] You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church: the Aramaic word kepa - meaning rock and transliterated into Greek as Kephas is the name by which Peter is called in the Pauline letters ( 1 Cor 1:12; 3:22; 9:5; 15:4; Gal 1:18; 2:9, 11, 14) except in Gal 2:7-8 (\"Peter\"). It is translated as Petros (\"Peter\") in John 1:42. The presumed original Aramaic of Jesus' statement would have been, in English, \"You are the Rock (Kepa) and upon this rock (kepa) I will build my church.\" The Greek text probably means the same, for the difference in gender between the masculine noun petros, the disciple's new name, and the feminine noun petra (rock) may be due simply to the unsuitability of using a feminine noun as the proper name of a male. Although the two words were generally used with slightly different nuances, they were also used interchangeably with the same meaning, \"rock.\" Church: this word (Greek ekklesia) occurs in the gospels only here and in Matthew 18:17 (twice). There are several possibilities for an Aramaic original. Jesus' church means the community that he will gather and that, like a building, will have Peter as its solid foundation. That function of Peter consists in his being witness to Jesus as the Messiah, the Son of the living God. The gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it: the netherworld (Greek Hades, the abode of the dead) is conceived of as a walled city whose gates will not close in upon the church of Jesus, i.e., it will not be overcome by the power of death","14":"[19] The keys to the kingdom of heaven: the image of the keys is probably drawn from Isaiah 22:15-25 where Eliakim, who succeeds Shebnah as master of the palace, is given \"the key of the house of David,\" which he authoritatively \"opens\" and \"shuts\" ( Isaiah 22:22). Whatever you bind . . . loosed in heaven: there are many instances in rabbinic literature of the binding-loosing imagery. Of the several meanings given there to the metaphor, two are of special importance here: the giving of authoritative teaching, and the lifting or imposing of the ban of excommunication. It is disputed whether the image of the keys and that of binding and loosing are different metaphors meaning the same thing. In any case, the promise of the keys is given to Peter alone. In Matthew 18:18 all the disciples are given the power of binding and loosing, but the context of that verse suggests that there the power of excommunication alone is intended. That the keys are those to the kingdom of heaven and that Peter's exercise of authority in the church on earth will be confirmed in heaven show an intimate connection between, but not an identification of, the church and the kingdom of heaven","15":"[20] Cf Mark 8:30. Matthew makes explicit that the prohibition has to do with speaking of Jesus as the Messiah; see the note on Mark 8:27-30","16":"[21-23] This first prediction of the passion follows Mark 8:31-33 in the main and serves as a corrective to an understanding of Jesus' messiahship as solely one of glory and triumph. By his addition of from that time on ( Matthew 16:21) Matthew has emphasized that Jesus' revelation of his coming suffering and death marks a new phase of the gospel. Neither this nor the two later passion predictions ( Matthew 17:22-23; 20:17-19) can be taken as sayings that, as they stand, go back to Jesus himself. However, it is probable that he foresaw that his mission would entail suffering and perhaps death, but was confident that he would ultimately be vindicated by God (see Matthew 26:29)","17":"[21] He: the Marcan parallel ( Mark 8:31) has \"the Son of Man.\" Since Matthew has already designated Jesus by that title (13), its omission here is not significant. The Matthean prediction is equally about the sufferings of the Son of Man. Must: this necessity is part of the tradition of all the synoptics; cf Mark 8:31; Luke 9:21. The elders, the chief priests, and the scribes: see the note on Mark 8:31. On the third day: so also Luke 9:22, against the Marcan \"after three days\" ( Mark 8:31). Matthew's formulation is, in the Greek, almost identical with the pre-Pauline fragment of the kerygma in 1 Cor 15:4 and also with Hosea 6:2 which many take to be the Old Testament background to the confession that Jesus was raised on the third day. Josephus uses \"after three days\" and \"on the third day\" interchangeably (Antiquities 7, 11, 6 #280-81; 8, 8, 1-2 #214, 218) and there is probably no difference in meaning between the two phrases","18":"[22-23] Peter's refusal to accept Jesus' predicted suffering and death is seen as a satanic attempt to deflect Jesus from his God-appointed course, and the disciple is addressed in terms that recall Jesus' dismissal of the devil in the temptation account ( Matthew 4:10: \"Get away, Satan!\"). Peter's satanic purpose is emphasized by Matthew's addition to the Marcan source of the words You are an obstacle to me","19":"[24-28] A readiness to follow Jesus even to giving up one's life for him is the condition for true discipleship; this will be repaid by him at the final judgment","20":"[24] Deny himself: to deny someone is to disown him (see Matthew 10:33; 26:34-35) and to deny oneself is to disown oneself as the center of one's existence","21":"[25] See the notes on Matthew 10:38, 39","22":"[27] The parousia and final judgment are described in Matthew 25:31 in terms almost identical with these","23":"[28] Coming in his kingdom: since the kingdom of the Son of Man has been described as \"the world\" and Jesus' sovereignty precedes his final coming in glory ( Matthew 13:38, 41), the coming in this verse is not the parousia as in the preceding but the manifestation of Jesus' rule after his resurrection; see the notes on Matthew 13:38, 41"}},"19":{"verses":{"1":{"verse":"When Jesus finished these words, he left Galilee and went to the district of Judea across the Jordan.","annotations":["1","2","3"]},"2":{"verse":"Great crowds followed him, and he cured them there.","annotations":[]},"3":{"verse":"Some Pharisees approached him, and tested him, saying, \"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause whatever?\"","annotations":["4"]},"4":{"verse":"He said in reply, \"Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female'","annotations":["5"]},"5":{"verse":"and said, 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'?","annotations":[]},"6":{"verse":"So they are no longer two, but one flesh.

The first part ( Matthew 19:1- 20:34) has for its setting the journey of Jesus from Galilee to Jerusalem; the second ( Matthew 21:1- 23:39) deals with Jesus' ministry in Jerusalem up to the final great discourse of the gospel (Matthew 24-25). Matthew follows the Marcan sequence of events, though adding material both special to this gospel and drawn from Q. The second part ends with the denunciation of the scribes and Pharisees ( Matthew 23:1-36) followed by Jesus' lament over Jerusalem ( Matthew 23:37-39). This long and important speech raises a problem for the view that Matthew is structured around five other discourses of Jesus (see Introduction) and that this one has no such function in the gospel. However, it is to be noted that this speech lacks the customary concluding formula that follows the five discourses (see the note on Matthew 7:28), and that those discourses are all addressed either exclusively (Matthew 10;18;24;25) or primarily (Matthew 5-7;13) to the disciples, whereas this is addressed primarily to the scribes and Pharisees (Matthew 13-36). Consequently, it seems plausible to maintain that the evangelist did not intend to give it the structural importance of the five other discourses, and that, in spite of its being composed of sayings-material, it belongs to the narrative section of this book. In that regard, it is similar to the sayings-material of Matthew 11:7-30. Some have proposed that Matthew wished to regard it as part of the final discourse of Matthew 24-25, but the intervening material ( Matthew 24:1-4) and the change in matter and style of those chapters do not support that view","2":"[1] In giving Jesus' teaching on divorce ( Matthew 19:3-9), Matthew here follows his Marcan source ( Mark 10:2-12) as he does Q in Matthew 5:31-32 (cf Luke 16:18). Matthew 19:10-12 are peculiar to Matthew","3":"[1] When Jesus finished these words: see the note on Matthew 7:28-29. The district of Judea across the Jordan: an inexact designation of the territory. Judea did not extend across the Jordan; the territory east of the river was Perea. The route to Jerusalem by way of Perea avoided passage through Samaria.","4":"[3] Tested him: the verb is used of attempts of Jesus' opponents to embarrass him by challenging him to do something they think impossible ( Matthew 16:1; Mark 8:11; Luke 11:16) or by having him say something that they can use against him ( Matthew 22:18, 35; Mark 10:2; 12:15). For any cause whatever: this is peculiar to Matthew and has been interpreted by some as meaning that Jesus was being asked to take sides in the dispute between the schools of Hillel and Shammai on the reasons for divorce, the latter holding a stricter position than the former. It is unlikely, however, that to ask Jesus' opinion about the differing views of two Jewish schools, both highly respected, could be described as \"testing\" him, for the reason indicated above","5":"[4-6] Matthew recasts his Marcan source, omitting Jesus' question about Moses' command ( Mark 10:3) and having him recall at once two Genesis texts that show the will and purpose of the Creator in making human beings male and female ( Genesis 1:27), namely, that a man may be joined to his wife in marriage in the intimacy of one flesh ( Genesis 2:24). What God has thus joined must not be separated by any human being. (The NAB translation of the Hebrew basar of Genesis 2:24 as \"body\" rather than \"flesh\" obscures the reference of Matthew to that text.","6":"[7] See Deut 24:1-","7":"[9] Moses' concession to human sinfulness (the hardness of your hearts, Matthew 19:8) is repudiated by Jesus, and the original will of the Creator is reaffirmed against that concession. (Unless the marriage is unlawful): see the note on Matthew 5:31-32. There is some evidence suggesting that Jesus' absolute prohibition of divorce was paralleled in the Qumran community (see 11QTemple 57:17-19; CD 4:12b-5:14). Matthew removes Mark's setting of this verse as spoken to the disciples alone \"in the house\" ( Mark 10:10) and also his extension of the divorce prohibition to the case of a woman's divorcing her husband ( Matthew 10:12), probably because in Palestine, unlike the places where Roman and Greek law prevailed, the woman was not allowed to initiate the divorce","8":"[11] [This] word: probably the disciples' \"it is better not to marry\" ( Matthew 19:10). Jesus agrees but says that celibacy is not for all but only for those to whom that is granted by God","9":"[12] Incapable of marriage: literally, \"eunuchs.\" Three classes are mentioned, eunuchs from birth, eunuchs by castration, and those who have voluntarily renounced marriage (literally, \"have made themselves eunuchs\") for the sake of the kingdom, i.e., to devote themselves entirely to its service. Some scholars take the last class to be those who have been divorced by their spouses and have refused to enter another marriage. But it is more likely that it is rather those who have chosen never to marry, since that suits better the optional nature of the decision: whoever can . . . ought to accept it","10":"[13-15] This account is understood by some as intended to justify the practice of infant baptism. That interpretation is based principally on the command not to prevent the children from coming, since that word sometimes has a baptismal connotation in the New Testament; see Acts 8:36","11":"[16-30] Cf Mark 10:17-31. This story does not set up a \"two-tier\" morality, that of those who seek (only) eternal life ( Matthew 19:16) and that of those who wish to be perfect ( Matthew 16:21). It speaks rather of the obstacle that riches constitute for the following of Jesus and of the impossibility, humanly speaking, for one who has many possessions ( Matthew 16:22) to enter the kingdom ( Matthew 16:24). Actual renunciation of riches is not demanded of all; Matthew counts the rich Joseph of Arimathea as a disciple of Jesus ( Matthew 27:57). But only the poor in spirit ( Matthew 5:3) can enter the kingdom and, as here, such poverty may entail the sacrifice of one's possessions. The Twelve, who have given up everything ( Matthew 16:27) to follow Jesus, will have as their reward a share in Jesus' (the Son of Man's) judging the twelve tribes of Israel ( Matthew 16:28), and all who have similarly sacrificed family or property for his sake will inherit eternal life (Matthew 16:29)","12":"[16] Gain eternal life: this is equivalent to \"entering into life\" ( Matthew 19:17) and \"being saved\" ( Matthew 16:25); the life is that of the new age after the final judgment (see Matthew 25:46). It probably is also equivalent here to \"entering the kingdom of heaven\" ( Matthew 19:23) or \"the kingdom of God\" ( Matthew 19:24), but see the notes on Matthew 3:2; 4:17; 18:1 for the wider reference of the kingdom in Matthew","13":"[17] By Matthew's reformulation of the Marcan question and reply ( Mark 10:17-18) Jesus' repudiation of the term \"good\" for himself has been softened. Yet the Marcan assertion that \"no one is good but God alone\" stands, with only unimportant verbal modification","14":"[18-19] The first five commandments cited are from the Decalogue (see Exodus 20:12-16; Deut 5:16-20). Matthew omits Mark's \"you shall not defraud\" ( Matthew 10:19; see Deut 24:14) and adds Lev 19:18. This combination of commandments of the Decalogue with Lev 19:18 is partially the same as Paul's enumeration of the demands of Christian morality in Romans 13:9","15":"[20] Young man: in Matthew alone of the synoptics the questioner is said to be a young man; thus the Marcan \"from my youth\" ( Matthew 10:20) is omitted","16":"[21] If you wish to be perfect: to be perfect is demanded of all Christians; see Matthew 5:48. In the case of this man, it involves selling his possessions and giving to the poor; only so can he follow Jesus","17":"[23-24] Riches are an obstacle to entering the kingdom that cannot be overcome by human power. The comparison with the impossibility of a camel's passing through the eye of a needle should not be mitigated by such suppositions as that the eye of a needle means a low or narrow gate. The kingdom of God: as in Matthew 12:28; 21:31, 43 instead of Matthew's usual kingdom of heaven","18":"[25-26] See the note on Mark 10:23-27","19":"[28] This saying, directed to the Twelve, is from Q; see Luke 22:29-30. The new age: the Greek word here translated \"new age\" occurs in the New Testament only here and in Titus 3:5. Literally, it means \"rebirth\" or \"regeneration,\" and is used in Titus of spiritual rebirth through baptism. Here it means the \"rebirth\" effected by the coming of the kingdom. Since that coming has various stages (see the notes on Matthew 3:2; 4:17), the new age could be taken as referring to the time after the resurrection when the Twelve will govern the true Israel, i.e., the church of Jesus. (For \"judge\" in the sense of \"govern,\" cf Judges 12:8, 9, 11; 15:20; 16:31; Psalm 2:10). But since it is connected here with the time when the Son of Man will be seated on his throne of glory, language that Matthew uses in Matthew 25:31 for the time of final judgment, it is more likely that what the Twelve are promised is that they will be joined with Jesus then in judging the people of Israel","20":"[30] Different interpretations have been given to this saying, which comes from Mark 10:31. In view of Matthew's associating it with the following parable ( Matthew 20:1-15) and substantially repeating it (in reverse order) at the end of that parable ( Matthew 20:16), it may be that his meaning is that all who respond to the call of Jesus, at whatever time (first or last), will be the same in respect to inheriting the benefits of the kingdom, which is the gift of God"}},"28":{"verses":{"1":{"verse":"After the sabbath, as the first day of the week was dawning, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.","annotations":["1","2"]},"2":{"verse":"And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, approached, rolled back the stone, and sat upon it.","annotations":["3"]},"3":{"verse":"His appearance was like lightning and his clothing was white as snow.","annotations":[]},"4":{"verse":"The guards were shaken with fear of him and became like dead men.","annotations":[]},"5":{"verse":"Then the angel said to the women in reply, \"Do not be afraid!

Even where he follows Mark, Matthew has altered his source so greatly that a very different impression is given from that of the Marcan account. The two points that are common to the resurrection testimony of all the gospels are that the tomb of Jesus had been found empty and that the risen Jesus had appeared to certain persons, or, in the original form of Mark, that such an appearance was promised as soon to take place (see Mark 16:7). On this central and all-important basis, Matthew has constructed an account that interprets the resurrection as the turning of the ages ( Matthew 28:2-4), shows the Jewish opposition to Jesus as continuing to the present in the claim that the resurrection is a deception perpetrated by the disciples who stole his body from the tomb ( Matthew 28:11-15), and marks a new stage in the mission of the disciples once limited to Israel ( Matthew 10:5-6); now they are to make disciples of all nations. In this work they will be strengthened by the presence of the exalted Son of Man, who will be with them until the kingdom comes in fullness at the end of the age ( Matthew 28:16-20)","2":"[1] After the sabbath . . . dawning: since the sabbath ended at sunset, this could mean in the early evening, for dawning can refer to the appearance of the evening star; cf Luke 23:54. However, it is probable that Matthew means the morning dawn of the day after the sabbath, as in the similar though slightly different text of Mark, \"when the sun had risen\" ( Mark 16:2). Mary Magdalene and the other Mary: see the notes on Matthew 27:55-56; 57-61. To see the tomb: cf Mark 16:1-2 where the purpose of the women's visit is to anoint Jesus' body.","3":"[2-4] Peculiar to Matthew. A great earthquake: see the note on Matthew 27:51-53. Descended from heaven: this trait is peculiar to Matthew, although his interpretation of the \"young man\" of his Marcan source ( Mark 16:5) as an angel is probably true to Mark's intention; cf Luke 24:23 where the \"two men\" of Matthew 24:4 are said to be \"angels.\" Rolled back the stone . . . upon it: not to allow the risen Jesus to leave the tomb but to make evident that the tomb is empty (see Matthew 24:6). Unlike the apocryphal Gospel of Peter (9, 35 - 11, 44), the New Testament does not describe the resurrection of Jesus, nor is there anyone who sees it. His appearance was like lightning . . . snow: see the note on Matthew 17:2","4":"[6-7] Cf Mark 16:6-7. Just as he said: a Matthean addition referring to Jesus' predictions of his resurrection, e.g., Matthew 16:21; 17:23; 20:19. Tell his disciples: like the angel of the Lord of the infancy narrative, the angel interprets a fact and gives a commandment about what is to be done; cf Matthew 1:20-21. Matthew omits Mark's \"and Peter\" ( Mark 16:7); considering his interest in Peter, this omission is curious. Perhaps the reason is that the Marcan text may allude to a first appearance of Jesus to Peter alone (cf 1 Cor 15:5; Luke 24:34) which Matthew has already incorporated into his account of Peter's confession at Caesarea Philippi; see the note on Matthew 16:16. He is going . . . Galilee: like Mark 16:7, a reference to Jesus' prediction at the Last Supper ( Matthew 26:32; Mark 14:28). Matthew changes Mark's \"as he told you\" to a declaration of the angel","5":"[8] Contrast Mark 16:8 where the women in their fear \"said nothing to anyone.&quot","6":"[9-10] Although these verses are peculiar to Matthew, there are similarities between them and John's account of the appearance of Jesus to Mary Magdalene ( John 20:17). In both there is a touching of Jesus' body, and a command of Jesus to bear a message to his disciples, designated as his brothers. Matthew may have drawn upon a tradition that appears in a different form in John. Jesus' words to the women are mainly a repetition of those of the angel ( Matthew 28:5a, 7b)","7":"[11-15] This account indicates that the dispute between Christians and Jews about the empty tomb was not whether the tomb was empty but why","8":"[16-20] This climactic scene has been called a \"proleptic parousia,\" for it gives a foretaste of the final glorious coming of the Son of Man ( Matthew 26:64). Then his triumph will be manifest to all; now it is revealed only to the disciples, who are commissioned to announce it to all nations and bring them to belief in Jesus and obedience to his commandments","9":"[16] The eleven: the number recalls the tragic defection of Judas Iscariot. To the mountain . . . ordered them: since the message to the disciples was simply that they were to go to Galilee ( Matthew 28:10), some think that the mountain comes from a tradition of the message known to Matthew and alluded to here. For the significance of the mountain, see the note on Matthew 17:1","10":"[17] But they doubted: the Greek can also be translated, \"but some doubted.\" The verb occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in Matthew 14:31 where it is associated with Peter's being of \"little faith.\" For the meaning of that designation, see the note on Matthew 6:30","11":"[18] All power . . . me: the Greek word here translated power is the same as that found in the LXX translation of Daniel 7:13-14 where one \"like a son of man\" is given power and an everlasting kingdom by God. The risen Jesus here claims universal power, i.e., in heaven and on earth","12":"[19] Therefore: since universal power belongs to the risen Jesus ( Matthew 28:18), he gives the eleven a mission that is universal. They are to make disciples of all nations. While all nations is understood by some scholars as referring only to all Gentiles, it is probable that it included the Jews as well. Baptizing them: baptism is the means of entrance into the community of the risen one, the Church. In the name of the Father . . . holy Spirit: this is perhaps the clearest expression in the New Testament of trinitarian belief. It may have been the baptismal formula of Matthew's church, but primarily it designates the effect of baptism, the union of the one baptized with the Father, Son, and holy Spirit","13":"[20] All that I have commanded you: the moral teaching found in this gospel, preeminently that of the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7). The commandments of Jesus are the standard of Christian conduct, not the Mosaic law as such, even though some of the Mosaic commandments have now been invested with the authority of Jesus. Behold, I am with you always: the promise of Jesus' real though invisible presence echoes the name Emmanuel given to him in the infancy narrative; see the note on Matthew 1:23. End of the age: see the notes on Matthew 13:39 and Matthew 24:3"}},"0":{"verses":{"1":"Matthew\nIntroduction\nThe position of the Gospel according to Matthew as the first of the four gospels in the New Testament reflects both the view that it was the first to be written, a view that goes back to the late second century A.D., and the esteem in which it was held by the church; no other was so frequently quoted in the noncanonical literature of earliest Christianity. Although the majority of scholars now reject the opinion about the time of its composition, the high estimation of this work remains. The reason for that becomes clear upon study of the way in which Matthew presents his story of Jesus, the demands of Christian discipleship, and the breaking-in of the new and final age through the ministry but particularly through the death and resurrection of Jesus\nThe gospel begins with a narrative prologue ( Matthew 1:1- 2:23), the first part of which is a genealogy of Jesus starting with Abraham, the father of Israel ( Matthew 1:1-17). Yet at the beginning of that genealogy Jesus is designated as \"the son of David, the son of Abraham\" ( Matthew 1:1). The kingly ancestor who lived about a thousand years after Abraham is named first, for this is the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Messiah, the royal anointed one ( Matthew 1:16). In the first of the episodes of the infancy narrative that follow the genealogy, the mystery of Jesus' person is declared. He is conceived of a virgin by the power of the Spirit of God ( Matthew 1:18-25). The first of the gospel's fulfillment citations, whose purpose it is to show that he was the one to whom the prophecies of Israel were pointing, occurs here ( Matthew 1:23): he shall be named Emmanuel, for in him God is with us\nThe announcement of the birth of this newborn king of the Jews greatly troubles not only King Herod but all Jerusalem ( Matthew 2:1-3), yet the Gentile magi are overjoyed to find him and offer him their homage and their gifts ( Matthew 2:10-11). Thus his ultimate rejection by the mass of his own people and his acceptance by the Gentile nations is foreshadowed. He must be taken to Egypt to escape the murderous plan of Herod. By his sojourn there and his subsequent return after the king's death he relives the Exodus experience of Israel. The words of the Lord spoken through the prophet Hosea, \"Out of Egypt I called my son,\" are fulfilled in him ( Matthew 2:15); if Israel was God's son, Jesus is so in a way far surpassing the dignity of that nation, as his marvelous birth and the unfolding of his story show (see Matthew 3:17; 4:1-11; 11:27; 14:33; 16:16; 27:54). Back in the land of Israel, he must be taken to Nazareth in Galilee because of the danger to his life in Judea, where Herod's son Archelaus is now ruling ( Matthew 2:22-23). The sufferings of Jesus in the infancy narrative anticipate those of his passion, and if his life is spared in spite of the dangers, it is because his destiny is finally to give it on the cross as \"a ransom for many\" (20, 28). Thus the word of the angel will be fulfilled, \". . . he will save his people from their sins\" ( Matthew 1:21; cf Matthew 26:28)\nIn Matthew 4:12 Matthew begins his account of the ministry of Jesus, introducing it by the preparatory preaching of John the Baptist ( Matthew 3:1-12), the baptism of Jesus that culminates in God's proclaiming him his \"beloved Son\" ( Matthew 3:13-17), and the temptation in which he proves his true sonship by his victory over the devil's attempt to deflect him from the way of obedience to the Father ( Matthew 4:1-11). The central message of Jesus' preaching is the coming of the kingdom of heaven and the need for repentance, a complete change of heart and conduct, on the part of those who are to receive this great gift of God ( Matthew 4:17). Galilee is the setting for most of his ministry; he leaves there for Judea only in Matthew 19:1, and his ministry in Jerusalem, the goal of his journey, is limited to a few days ( Matthew 21:1- 25:46)\nIn this extensive material there are five great discourses of Jesus, each concluding with the formula \"When Jesus finished these words\" or one closely similar ( Matthew 7:28; 11:1; 13:53; 19:1; 26:1). These are an important structure of the gospel. In every case the discourse is preceded by a narrative section, each narrative and discourse together constituting a \"book\" of the gospel. The discourses are, respectively, the \"Sermon on the Mount\" ( Matthew 5:3- 7:27), the missionary discourse ( Matthew 10:5-42), the parable discourse ( Matthew 13:3-52), the \"church order\" discourse ( Matthew 18:3-35), and the eschatological discourse ( Matthew 24:4- 25:46). In large measure the material of these discourses came to Matthew from his tradition, but his work in modifying and adding to what he had received is abundantly evident. No other evangelist gives the teaching of Jesus with such elegance and order as he\nIn the \"Sermon on the Mount\" the theme of righteousness is prominent, and even at this early stage of the ministry the note of opposition is struck between Jesus and the Pharisees, who are designated as \"the hypocrites\" ( Matthew 6:2, 5, 16). The righteousness of his disciples must surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees; otherwise, in spite of their alleged following of Jesus, they will not enter into the kingdom of heaven ( Matthew 5:20). Righteousness means doing the will of the heavenly Father ( Matthew 7:21), and his will is proclaimed in a manner that is startling to all who have identified it with the law of Moses. The antitheses of the Sermon ( Matthew 5:21-48) both accept ( Matthew 5:21-30, 43-48) and reject ( Matthew 5:31-42) elements of that law, and in the former case the understanding of the law's demands is deepened and extended. The antitheses are the best commentary on the meaning of Jesus' claim that he has come not to abolish but to fulfill the law ( Matthew 5:17). What is meant by fulfillment of the law is not the demand to keep it exactly as it stood before the coming of Jesus, but rather his bringing the law to be a lasting expression of the will of God, and in that fulfillment there is much that will pass away. Should this appear contradictory to his saying that \"until heaven and earth pass away\" not even the smallest part of the law will pass ( Matthew 5:18), that time of fulfillment is not the dissolution of the universe but the coming of the new age, which will occur with Jesus' death and resurrection. While righteousness in the new age will continue to mean conduct that is in accordance with the law, it will be conduct in accordance with the law as expounded and interpreted by Jesus (cf Matthew 28:20, \". . . all that I have commanded you\")\nThough Jesus speaks harshly about the Pharisees in the Sermon, his judgment is not solely a condemnation of them. The Pharisees are portrayed as a negative example for his disciples, and his condemnation of those who claim to belong to him while disobeying his word is no less severe ( Matthew 7:21-23, 26-27)\nIn Matthew 4:23 a summary statement of Jesus' activity speaks not only of his teaching and proclaiming the gospel but of his \"curing every disease and illness among the people\"; this is repeated almost verbatim in Matthew 9:35. The narrative section that follows the Sermon on the Mount ( Matthew 8:1- 9:38) is composed principally of accounts of those merciful deeds of Jesus, but it is far from being simply a collection of stories about miraculous cures. The nature of the community that Jesus will establish is shown; it will always be under the protection of him whose power can deal with all dangers ( Matthew 8:23-27), but it is only for those who are prepared to follow him at whatever cost ( Matthew 8:16-22), not only believing Israelites but Gentiles who have come to faith in him ( Matthew 8:10-12). The disciples begin to have some insight, however imperfect, into the mystery of Jesus' person. They wonder about him whom \"the winds and the sea obey\" ( Matthew 8:27), and they witness his bold declaration of the forgiveness of the paralytic's sins ( Matthew 9:2). That episode of the narrative moves on two levels. When the crowd sees the cure that testifies to the authority of Jesus, the Son of Man, to forgive sins ( Matthew 9:6), they glorify God \"who had given such authority to human beings\" ( Matthew 9:8). The forgiveness of sins is now not the prerogative of Jesus alone but of \"human beings,\" that is, of the disciples who constitute the community of Jesus, the church. The ecclesial character of this narrative section could hardly be more plainly indicated\nThe end of the section prepares for the discourse on the church's mission ( Matthew 10:5-42). Jesus is moved to pity at the sight of the crowds who are like sheep without a shepherd ( Matthew 9:36), and he sends out the twelve disciples to make the proclamation with which his own ministry began, \"The kingdom of heaven is at hand\" ( Matthew 10:7; cf Matthew 4:17), and to drive out demons and cure the sick as he has done ( Matthew 10:1). Their mission is limited to Israel ( Matthew 10:5-6) as Jesus' own was ( Matthew 15:24), yet in Matthew 15:16 that perspective broadens and the discourse begins to speak of the mission that the disciples will have after the resurrection and of the severe persecution that will attend it ( Matthew 10:18). Again, the discourse moves on two levels: that of the time of Jesus and that of the time of the church\nThe narrative section of the third book ( Matthew 11:2- 12:50) deals with the growing opposition to Jesus. Hostility toward him has already beenmanifested ( Matthew 8:10; 9:3, 10-13, 34), but here it becomes more intense. The rejection of Jesus comes, as before, from Pharisees, who take \"counsel against him to put him to death\" ( Matthew 12:14) and repeat their earlier accusation that he drives out demons because he is in league with demonic power ( Matthew 12:22-24). But they are not alone in their rejection. Jesus complains of the lack of faith of \"this generation\" of Israelites ( Matthew 11:16-19) and reproaches the towns \"where most of his mighty deeds had been done\" for not heeding his call to repentance ( Matthew 11:20-24). This dark picture is relieved by Jesus' praise of the Father who has enabled \"the childlike\" to accept him ( Matthew 11:25-27), but on the whole the story is one of opposition to his word and blindness to the meaning of his deeds. The whole section ends with his declaring that not even the most intimate blood relationship with him counts for anything; his only true relatives are those who do the will of his heavenly Father ( Matthew 12:48-50)\nThe narrative of rejection leads up to the parable discourse ( Matthew 13:3-52). The reason given for Jesus' speaking to the crowds in parables is that they have hardened themselves against his clear teaching, unlike the disciples to whom knowledge of \"the mysteries of the kingdom has been granted\" ( Matthew 13:10-16). In Matthew 13:36 he dismisses the crowds and continues the discourse to his disciples alone, who claim, at the end, to have understood all that he has said ( Matthew 13:51). But, lest the impression be given that the church of Jesus is made up only of true disciples, the explanation of the parable of the weeds among the wheat ( Matthew 13:37-43), as well as the parable of the net thrown into the sea \"which collects fish of every kind\" ( Matthew 13:47-49), shows that it is composed of both the righteous and the wicked, and that separation between the two will be made only at the time of the final judgment\nIn the narrative that constitutes the first part of the fourth book of the gospel ( Matthew 13:54- 17:27), Jesus is shown preparing for the establishment of his church with its teaching authority that will supplant the blind guidance of the Pharisees ( Matthew 15:13-14), whose teaching, curiously said to be that of the Sadducees also, is repudiated by Jesus as the norm for his disciples ( Matthew 16:6, 11-12). The church of Jesus will be built on Peter ( Matthew 16:18), who will be given authority to bind and loose on earth, an authority whose exercise will be confirmed in heaven ( Matthew 16:19). The metaphor of binding and loosing has a variety of meanings, among them that of giving authoritative teaching. This promise is made to Peter directly after he has confessed Jesus to be the Messiah, the Son of the living God ( Matthew 16:16), a confession that he has made as the result of revelation given to him by the heavenly Father ( Matthew 16:17); Matthew's ecclesiology is based on his high christology\nDirectly after that confession Jesus begins to instruct his disciples about how he must go the way of suffering and death ( Matthew 16:21). Peter, who has been praised for his confession, protests against this and receives from Jesus the sharpest of rebukes for attempting to deflect Jesus from his God-appointed destiny. The future rock upon whom the church will be built is still a man of \"little faith\" (see Matthew 14:31). Both he and the other disciples must know not only that Jesus will have to suffer and die but that they too will have to follow him on the way of the cross if they are truly to be his disciples ( Matthew 16:24-25)\nThe discourse following this narrative ( Matthew 18:1-35) is often called the \"church order\" discourse, although that title is perhaps misleading since the emphasis is not on the structure of the church but on the care that the disciples must have for one another in respect to guarding each other's faith in Jesus ( Matthew 18:6-7), to seeking out those who have wandered from the fold ( Matthew 18:10-14), and to repeated forgiving of their fellow disciples who have offended them ( Matthew 18:21-35). But there is also the obligation to correct the sinful fellow Christian and, should one refuse to be corrected, separation from the community is demanded ( Matthew 18:15-18)\nThe narrative of the fifth book ( Matthew 19:1- 23:39) begins with the departure of Jesus and his disciples from Galilee for Jerusalem. In the course of their journey Jesus for the third time predicts the passion that awaits him at Jerusalem and also his resurrection ( Matthew 20:17-19). At his entrance into the city he is hailed as the Son of David by the crowds accompanying him ( Matthew 21:9). He cleanses the temple ( Matthew 21:12-17), and in the few days of his Jerusalem ministry he engages in a series of controversies with the Jewish religious leaders ( Matthew 21:23-27; 22:15-22, 23-33, 34-40, 41-46), meanwhile speaking parables against them ( Matthew 21:28-32, 33-46), against all those Israelites who have rejected God's invitation to the messianic banquet ( Matthew 22:1-10), and against all, Jew and Gentile, who have accepted but have shown themselves unworthy of it ( Matthew 22:11-14). Once again, the perspective of the evangelist includes not only the time of Jesus' ministry but that of the preaching of the gospel after his resurrection. The narrative culminates in Jesus' denunciation of the scribes and Pharisees, reflecting not only his own opposition to them but that of Matthew's church ( Matthew 23:1-36), and in Jesus' lament over Jerusalem ( Matthew 23:37-39)\nIn the discourse of the fifth book ( Matthew 24:1- 25:46), the last of the great structural discoursesof the gospel, Jesus predicts the destruction of the temple and his own final coming. The time of the latter is unknown ( Matthew 24:36, 44), and the disciples are exhorted in various parables to live in readiness for it, a readiness that entails faithful attention to the duties of the interim period ( Matthew 24:45- 25:30). The coming of Jesus will bring with it the great judgment by which the everlasting destiny of all will be determined ( Matthew 25:31-46)\nThe story of Jesus' passion and resurrection ( Matthew 26:1- 28:20), the climax of the gospel, throws light on all that has preceded. In Matthew \"righteousness\" means both the faithful response to the will of God demanded of all to whom that will is announced and also the saving activity of God for his people (see Matthew 3:15; 5:6; 6:33). The passion supremely exemplifies both meanings of that central Matthean word. In Jesus' absolute faithfulness to the Father's will that he drink the cup of suffering ( Matthew 26:39), the incomparable model for Christian obedience is given; in his death \"for the forgiveness of sins\" ( Matthew 26:28), the saving power of God is manifested as never before\nMatthew's portrayal of Jesus in his passion combines both themajestic serenity of the obedient Son who goes his destined way in fulfillment of the scriptures ( Matthew 26:52-54), confident of his ultimate vindication by God, and the depths of fear and abandonment that he feels in face of death ( Matthew 26:38-39; 27:46). These two aspects are expressed by an Old Testament theme that occurs often in the narrative, i.e., the portrait of the suffering Righteous One who complains to God in his misery, but is certain of eventual deliverance from his terrible ordeal\nThe passion-resurrection of God's Son means nothing less than the turn of the ages, a new stage of history, the coming of the Son of Man in his kingdom ( Matthew 28:18; cf Matthew 16:28). That is the sense of the apocalyptic signs that accompany Jesus' death ( Matthew 27:51-53) and resurrection ( Matthew 28:2). Although the old age continues, as it will until the manifestation of Jesus' triumph at his parousia, the final age has now begun. This is known only to those who have seen the Risen One and to those, both Jews and Gentiles, who have believed in their announcement of Jesus' triumph and have themselves become his disciples (cf Matthew 28:19). To them he is constantly, though invisibly, present ( Matthew 28:20), verifying the name Emmanuel, \"God is with us\" (cf Matthew 1:23)\nThe questions of authorship, sources, and the time of composition of this gospel have received many answers, none of which can claim more than a greater or lesser degree of probability. The one now favored by the majority of scholars is the following\nThe ancient tradition that the author was the disciple and apostle of Jesus named Matthew (see Matthew 10:3) is untenable because the gospel is based, in large part, on the Gospel according to Mark (almost all the verses of that gospel have been utilized in this), and it is hardly likely that a companion of Jesus would have followed so extensively an account that came from one who admittedly never had such an association rather than rely on his own memories. The attribution of the gospel to the disciple Matthew may have been due to his having been responsible for some of the traditions found in it, but that is far from certain\nThe unknown author, whom we shall continue to call Matthew for the sake of convenience, drew not only upon the Gospel according to Mark but upon a large body of material (principally, sayings of Jesus) not found in Mark that corresponds, sometimes exactly, to material found also in the Gospel according to Luke. This material, called \"Q\" (probably from the first letter of the German word Quelle, meaning \"source\"), represents traditions, written and oral, used by both Matthew and Luke. Mark and Q are sources common to the two other synoptic gospels; hence the name the \"Two-Source Theory\" given to this explanation of the relation among the synoptics\nIn addition to what Matthew drew from Mark and Q, his gospel contains material that is found only there. This is often designated \"M,\" written or oral tradition that was available to the author. Since Mark was written shortly before or shortly after A.D. 70 (see Introduction to Mark), Matthew was composed certainly after that date, which marks the fall of Jerusalem to the Romans at the time of the First Jewish Revolt (A.D. 66-70), and probably at least a decade later since Matthew's use of Mark presupposes a wide diffusion of that gospel. The post - A.D. 70 date is confirmed within the text by Matthew 22:7, which refers to the destruction of Jerusalem\nAs for the place where the gospel was composed, a plausible suggestion is that it was Antioch, the capital of the Roman province of Syria. That large and important city had a mixed population of Greek-speaking Gentiles and Jews. The tensions between Jewish and Gentile Christians there in the time of Paul (see Gal 2:1-14) in respect to Christian obligation to observe Mosaic law are partially similar to tensions that can be seen between the two groups in Matthew's gospel. The church of Matthew, originally strongly Jewish Christian, had become one in which Gentile Christians were predominant. His gospel answers the question how obedience to the will of God is to be expressed by those who live after the \"turn of the ages,\" the death and resurrection of Jesus\nThe principal divisions of the Gospel according to Matthew are the following\nI.

The stories are arranged in three groups of three, each group followed by a section composed principally of sayings of Jesus about discipleship. Matthew 9:35 is an almost verbatim repetition of Matthew 4:23. Each speaks of Jesus' teaching, preaching, and healing. The teaching and preaching form the content of Matthew 5-7; the healing, that of Matthew 8-9. Some scholars speak of a portrayal of Jesus as \"Messiah of the Word\" in Matthew 5-7 and \"Messiah of the Deed\" in Matthew 8-9. That is accurate so far as it goes, but there is also a strong emphasis on discipleship in Matthew 8-9; these chapters have not only christological but ecclesiological import.","2":"[2] A leper: see the note on Mark 1:40","3":"[4] Cf Lev 14:2-9. That will be proof for them: the Greek can also mean \"that will be proof against them.\" It is not clear whether them refers to the priests or the people","4":"[5-13] This story comes from Q (see Luke 7:1-10) and is also reflected in John 4:46-54. The similarity between the Q story and the Johannine is due to a common oral tradition, not to a common literary source. As in the later story of the daughter of the Canaanite woman ( Matthew 15:21-28) Jesus here breaks with his usual procedure of ministering only to Israelites and anticipates the mission to the Gentiles","5":"[5] A centurion: a military officer commanding a hundred men. He was probably in the service of Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee; see the note on Matthew 14:1","6":"[8-9] Acquainted by his position with the force of a command, the centurion expresses faith in the power of Jesus' mere word","7":"[10] In no one in Israel: there is good textual attestation (e.g., Codex Sinaiticus) for a reading identical with that of Luke 7:9, \"not even in Israel.\" But that seems to be due to a harmonization of Matthew with Luke","8":"[11-12] Matthew inserts into the story a Q saying (see Luke 13:28-29) about the entrance of Gentiles into the kingdom and the exclusion of those Israelites who, though descended from the patriarchs and members of the chosen nation (the children of the kingdom), refused to believe in Jesus. There will be wailing and grinding of teeth: the first occurrence of a phrase used frequently in this gospel to describe final condemnation ( Matthew 13:42, 50; 22:13; 24:51; 25:30). It is found elsewhere in the New Testament only in Luke 13:28","9":"[14-15] Cf Mark 1:29-31. Unlike Mark, Matthew has no implied request by others for the woman's cure. Jesus acts on his own initiative, and the cured woman rises and waits not on \"them\" ( Mark 1:31) but on him","10":"[16] By a word: a Matthean addition to Mark 1:34; cf 8:8","11":"[17] This fulfillment citation from Isaiah 53:4 follows the MT, not the LXX. The prophet speaks of the Servant of the Lord who suffers vicariously for the sins (\"infirmities\") of others; Matthew takes the infirmities as physical afflictions","12":"[18-22] This passage between the first and second series of miracles about following Jesus is taken from Q (see Luke 9:57-62). The third of the three sayings found in the source is absent from Matthew","13":"[18] The other side: i.e., of the Sea of Galilee","14":"[19] Teacher: for Matthew, this designation of Jesus is true, for he has Jesus using it of himself ( Matthew 10:24, 25; 23:8; 26:18), yet when it is used of him by others they are either his opponents ( Matthew 9:11; 12:38; 17:24; 22:16, 24, 36) or, as here and in Matthew 19:16, well-disposed persons who cannot see more deeply. Thus it reveals an inadequate recognition of who Jesus is","15":"[20] Son of Man: see the note on Mark 8:31. This is the first occurrence in Matthew of a term that appears in the New Testament only in sayings of Jesus, except for Acts 7:56 and possibly Matthew 9:6 ( Mark 2:10; Luke 5:24). In Matthew it refers to Jesus in his ministry (seven times, as here), in his passion and resurrection (nine times, e.g., Matthew 17:22), and in his glorious coming at the end of the age (thirteen times, e.g., Matthew 24:30)","16":"[22] Let the dead bury their dead: the demand of Jesus overrides what both the Jewish and the Hellenistic world regarded as a filial obligation of the highest importance. See the note on Luke 9:60","17":"[23] His disciples followed him: the first miracle in the second group ( Matthew 8:23- 9:8) is introduced by a verse that links it with the preceding sayings by the catchword \"follow.\" In Mark the initiative in entering the boat is taken by the disciples ( Mark 4:35-41); here, Jesus enters first and the disciples follow","18":"[24] Storm: literally, \"earthquake,\" a word commonly used in apocalyptic literature for the shaking of the old world when God brings in his kingdom. All the synoptics use it in depicting the events preceding the parousia of the Son of Man ( Matthew 24:7; Mark 13:8; Luke 21:11). Matthew has introduced it here and in his account of the death and resurrection of Jesus ( Matthew 27:51-54; 28:2)","19":"[25] The reverent plea of the disciples contrasts sharply with their reproach of Jesus in Mark 4:38","20":"[26] You of little faith: see the note on Matthew 6:30. Great calm: Jesus' calming the sea may be meant to recall the Old Testament theme of God's control over the chaotic waters ( Psalm 65:8; 89:10; 93:3-4; 107:29)","21":"[28] Gadarenes: this is the reading of Codex Vaticanus, supported by other important textual witnesses. The original reading of Codex Sinaiticus was Gazarenes, later changed to Gergesenes, and a few versions have Gerasenes. Each of these readings points to a different territory connected, respectively, with the cities Gadara, Gergesa, and Gerasa (modern Jerash). There is the same confusion of readings in the parallel texts, Mark 5:1 and Luke 8:26; there the best reading seems to be \"Gerasenes,\" whereas \"Gadarenes\" is probably the original reading in Matthew. The town of Gadara was about five miles southeast of the Sea of Galilee, and Josephus (Life 9:42) refers to it as possessing territory that lay on that sea. Two demoniacs: Mark (5:1-20) has one","22":"[29] What have you to do with us?: see the note on John 2:4. Before the appointed time: the notion that evil spirits were allowed by God to afflict human beings until the time of the final judgment is found in Enoch 16:1 and Jubilees 10:7-10","23":"[30] The tending of pigs, animals considered unclean by Mosaic law ( Lev 11:6-7), indicates that the population was Gentile"}},"15":{"verses":{"1":{"verse":"Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said,","annotations":["1"]},"2":{"verse":"\"Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders?

Jesus' counterquestion accuses his opponents of breaking the commandment of God for the sake of their tradition ( Matthew 15:3) and illustrates this by their interpretation of the commandment of the Decalogue concerning parents ( Matthew 15:4-6). Denouncing them as hypocrites, he applies to them a derogatory prophecy of Isaiah ( Matthew 15:7-8). Then with a wider audience (the crowd, Matthew 15:10) he goes beyond the violation of tradition with which the dispute has started. The parable ( Matthew 15:11) is an attack on the Mosaic law concerning clean and unclean foods, similar to those antitheses that abrogate the law ( Matthew 5:31-32, 33-34, 38-39). After a warning to his disciples not to follow the moral guidance of the Pharisees ( Matthew 15:13-14), he explains the parable ( Matthew 15:15) to them, saying that defilement comes not from what enters the mouth ( Matthew 15:17) but from the evil thoughts and deeds that rise from within, from the heart ( Matthew 15:18-20). The last verse returns to the starting point of the dispute (eating with unwashed hands). Because of Matthew's omission of Mark 7:19b, some scholars think that Matthew has weakened the Marcan repudiation of the Mosaic food laws. But that half verse is ambiguous in the Greek, which may be the reason for its omission here.","2":"[2] The tradition of the elders: see the note on Mark 7:5. The purpose of the handwashing was to remove defilement caused by contact with what was ritually unclean","3":"[3-4] For the commandment see Exodus 20:12; Deut 5:16); 21:17. The honoring of one's parents had to do with supporting them in their needs","4":"[5] See the note on Mark 7:11","5":"[8] The text of Isaiah 29:13 is quoted approximately according to the Septuagint","6":"[13-14] Jesus leads his disciples away from the teaching authority of the Pharisees","7":"[15] Matthew specifies Peter as the questioner, unlike Mark 7:17. Given his tendency to present the disciples as more understanding than in his Marcan source, it is noteworthy that here he retains the Marcan rebuke, although in a slightly milder form. This may be due to his wish to correct the Jewish Christians within his church who still held to the food laws and thus separated themselves from Gentile Christians who did not observe them","8":"[19] The Marcan list of thirteen things that defile ( Matthew 7:21-22) is here reduced to seven that partially cover the content of the Decalogue.

Dogs: see the note on Matthew 7:6","12":"[28] As in the case of the cure of the centurion's servant ( Matthew 8:10), Matthew ascribes Jesus' granting the request to the woman's great faith, a point not made equally explicit in the Marcan parallel ( Matthew 7:24-30)","13":"[32-39] Most probably this story is a doublet of that of the feeding of the five thousand ( Matthew 14:13-21). It differs from it notably only in that Jesus takes the initiative, not the disciples ( Matthew 15:32), and in the numbers: the crowd has been with Jesus three days ( Matthew 15:32), seven loaves are multiplied ( Matthew 15:36), seven baskets of fragments remain after the feeding ( Matthew 15:37), and four thousand men are fed ( Matthew 15:38)","14":"[36] Gave thanks: see Matthew 14:19, \"said the blessing.\" There is no difference in meaning. The thanksgiving was a blessing of God for his benefits"}}}}
